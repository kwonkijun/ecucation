An Architecture and Management Platform for Blockchain-Based Personal Health Record Exchange: Development and Usability Study,"Hsiu-An Lee, Hsin-Hua Kung, Jai Ganesh Udayasankaran, Boonchai Kijsanayotin, Alvin B Marcelo, Louis R Chao, Chien-Yeh Hsu",J Med Internet Res 2020;22(6):e16748,"Background: Personal health record (PHR) security, correctness, and protection are essential for health and medical services. Blockchain architecture can provide efficient data retrieval and security requirements. Exchangeable PHRs and the self-management of patient health can offer many benefits to traditional medical services by allowing people to manage their own health records for disease prevention, prediction, and control while reducing resource burdens on the health care infrastructure and improving population health and quality of life.Objective: This study aimed to build a blockchain-based architecture for an international health record exchange platform to ensure health record confidentiality, integrity, and availability for health management and used Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource international standards as the data format that could allow international, cross-institutional, and patient/doctor exchanges of PHRs.Methods: The PHR architecture in this study comprised 2 main components. The first component was the PHR management platform, on which users could upload PHRs, view their record content, authorize PHR exchanges with doctors or other medical health care providers, and check their block information. When a PHR was uploaded, the hash value of the PHR would be calculated by the SHA-256 algorithm and the PHR would be encrypted by the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption mechanism before being transferred to a secure database. The second component was the blockchain exchange architecture, which was based on Ethereum to create a private chain. Proof of authority, which delivers transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity, was used for consensus. The hash value was calculated based on the previous hash value, block content, and timestamp by a hash function.Results: The PHR blockchain architecture constructed in this study is an effective method for the management and utilization of PHRs. The platform has been deployed in Southeast Asian countries via the Asia eHealth Information Network (AeHIN) and has become the first PHR management platform for cross-region medical data exchange.Conclusions: Some systems have shown that blockchain technology has great potential for electronic health record applications. This study combined different types of data storage modes to effectively solve the problems of PHR data security, storage, and transmission and proposed a hybrid blockchain and data security approach to enable effective international PHR exchange. By partnering with the AeHIN and making use of the network’s regional reach and expert pool, the platform could be deployed and promoted successfully. In the future, the PHR platform could be utilized for the purpose of precision and individual medicine in a cross-country manner because of the platform’s provision of a secure and efficient PHR sharing and management architecture, making it a reasonable base for future data collection sources and the data analytics needed for precision medicine."
"Privacy-Preserving Methods for Feature Engineering Using Blockchain: Review, Evaluation, and Proof of Concept","Michael Jones, Matthew Johnson, Mark Shervey, Joel T Dudley, Noah Zimmerman",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(8):e13600,"Background: The protection of private data is a key responsibility for research studies that collect identifiable information from study participants. Limiting the scope of data collection and preventing secondary use of the data are effective strategies for managing these risks. An ideal framework for data collection would incorporate feature engineering, a process where secondary features are derived from sensitive raw data in a secure environment without a trusted third party.Objective: This study aimed to compare current approaches based on how they maintain data privacy and the practicality of their implementations. These approaches include traditional approaches that rely on trusted third parties, and cryptographic, secure hardware, and blockchain-based techniques.Methods: A set of properties were defined for evaluating each approach. A qualitative comparison was presented based on these properties. The evaluation of each approach was framed with a use case of sharing geolocation data for biomedical research.Results: We found that approaches that rely on a trusted third party for preserving participant privacy do not provide sufficiently strong guarantees that sensitive data will not be exposed in modern data ecosystems. Cryptographic techniques incorporate strong privacy-preserving paradigms but are appropriate only for select use cases or are currently limited because of computational complexity. Blockchain smart contracts alone are insufficient to provide data privacy because transactional data are public. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) may have hardware vulnerabilities and lack visibility into how data are processed. Hybrid approaches combining blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and TEEs provide promising frameworks for privacy preservation. For reference, we provide a software implementation where users can privately share features of their geolocation data using the hybrid approach combining blockchain with TEEs as a supplement.Conclusions: Blockchain technology and smart contracts enable the development of new privacy-preserving feature engineering methods by obviating dependence on trusted parties and providing immutable, auditable data processing workflows. The overlap between blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and secure hardware technologies are promising fields for addressing important data privacy needs. Hybrid blockchain and TEE frameworks currently provide practical tools for implementing experimental privacy-preserving applications."
Building a Secure Biomedical Data Sharing Decentralized App (DApp): Tutorial,"Matthew Johnson, Michael Jones, Mark Shervey, Joel T Dudley, Noah Zimmerman",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(10):e13601,"unstructured: Decentralized apps (DApps) are computer programs that run on a distributed computing system, such as a blockchain network. Unlike the client-server architecture that powers most internet apps, DApps that are integrated with a blockchain network can execute app logic that is guaranteed to be transparent, verifiable, and immutable. This new paradigm has a number of unique properties that are attractive to the biomedical and health care communities. However, instructional resources are scarcely available for biomedical software developers to begin building DApps on a blockchain. Such apps require new ways of thinking about how to build, maintain, and deploy software. This tutorial serves as a complete working prototype of a DApp, motivated by a real use case in biomedical research requiring data privacy. We describe the architecture of a DApp, the implementation details of a smart contract, a sample iPhone operating system (iOS) DApp that interacts with the smart contract, and the development tools and libraries necessary to get started. The code necessary to recreate the app is publicly available."
Implementing Blockchains for Efficient Health Care: Systematic Review,"Anuraag A Vazirani, Odhran O'Donoghue, David Brindley, Edward Meinert",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(2):e12439,"Background: The decentralized nature of sensitive health information can bring about situations where timely information is unavailable, worsening health outcomes. Furthermore, as patient involvement in health care increases, there is a growing need for patients to access and control their data. Blockchain is a secure, decentralized online ledger that could be used to manage electronic health records (EHRs) efficiently, therefore with the potential to improve health outcomes by creating a conduit for interoperability.Objective: This study aimed to perform a systematic review to assess the feasibility of blockchain as a method of managing health care records efficiently.Methods: Reviewers identified studies via systematic searches of databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Cochrane Library. Suitability for inclusion of each was assessed independently.Results: Of the 71 included studies, the majority discuss potential benefits and limitations without evaluation of their effectiveness, although some systems were tested on live data.Conclusions: Blockchain could create a mechanism to manage access to EHRs stored on the cloud. Using a blockchain can increase interoperability while maintaining privacy and security of data. It contains inherent integrity and conforms to strict legal regulations. Increased interoperability would be beneficial for health outcomes. Although this technology is currently unfamiliar to most, investments into creating a sufficiently user-friendly interface and educating users on how best to take advantage of it would lead to improved health outcomes.registered-report: RR2-10.2196/10994"
Accelerating Health Data Sharing: A Solution Based on the Internet of Things and Distributed Ledger Technologies,"Xiaochen Zheng, Shengjing Sun, Raghava Rao Mukkamala, Ravi Vatrapu, Joaquín Ordieres-Meré",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(6):e13583,"Background: Huge amounts of health-related data are generated every moment with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable technologies. These big health data contain great value and can bring benefit to all stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. Currently, most of these data are siloed and fragmented in different health care systems or public and private databases. It prevents the fulfillment of intelligent health care inspired by these big data. Security and privacy concerns and the lack of ensured authenticity trails of data bring even more obstacles to health data sharing. With a decentralized and consensus-driven nature, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) provide reliable solutions such as blockchain, Ethereum, and IOTA Tangle to facilitate the health care data sharing.Objective: This study aimed to develop a health-related data sharing system by integrating IoT and DLT to enable secure, fee-less, tamper-resistant, highly-scalable, and granularly-controllable health data exchange, as well as build a prototype and conduct experiments to verify the feasibility of the proposed solution.Methods: The health-related data are generated by 2 types of IoT devices: wearable devices and stationary air quality sensors. The data sharing mechanism is enabled by IOTA’s distributed ledger, the Tangle, which is a directed acyclic graph. Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) is adopted to facilitate data communications among different parties. Merkle Hash Tree is used for data encryption and verification.Results: A prototype system was built according to the proposed solution. It uses a smartwatch and multiple air sensors as the sensing layer; a smartphone and a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) as the gateway; and a local server for data publishing. The prototype was applied to the remote diagnosis of tremor disease. The results proved that the solution could enable costless data integrity and flexible access management during data sharing.Conclusions: DLT integrated with IoT technologies could greatly improve the health-related data sharing. The proposed solution based on IOTA Tangle and MAM could overcome many challenges faced by other traditional blockchain-based solutions in terms of cost, efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in data access management. This study also showed the possibility of fully decentralized health data sharing by replacing the local server with edge computing devices."
"Towards a Stakeholder-Oriented Blockchain-Based Architecture for Electronic Health Records: Design Science Research Study
","Jan Heinrich Beinke, Christian Fitte, Frank Teuteberg",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(10):e13585,"Background: Data security issues still constitute the main reason for the sluggish dissemination of electronic health records (EHRs). Given that blockchain technology offers the possibility to verify transactions through a decentralized network, it may serve as a solution to secure health-related data. Therefore, we have identified stakeholder-specific requirements and propose a blockchain-based architecture for EHRs, while referring to the already existing scientific discussions on the potential of blockchain for use in EHRs.Objective: This study aimed to introduce blockchain technology for EHRs, based on identifying stakeholders and systematically eliciting their requirements, and to discuss the key benefits (KBs) and key challenges (KCs) of blockchain technology in the context of EHRs.Methods: The blockchain-based architecture was developed in the framework of the design science research paradigm. The requirements were identified using a structured literature review and interviews with nine health care experts. Subsequently, the proposed architecture was evaluated using 4 workshops with 15 participants.Results: We identified three major EHR stakeholder groups and 34 respective requirements. On this basis, we developed a five-layer architecture. The subsequent evaluation of the artifact was followed by the discussion of 12 KBs and 12 KCs of a blockchain-based architecture for EHRs. To address the KCs, we derived five recommendations for action for science and practice.Conclusions: Our findings indicate that blockchain technology offers considerable potential to advance EHRs. Improvements to currently available EHR solutions are expected, for instance, in the areas of data security, traceability, and automation by smart contracts. Future research could examine the patient’s acceptance of blockchain-based EHRs and cost-benefit analyses."
A Blockchain Framework for Patient-Centered Health Records and Exchange (HealthChain): Evaluation and Proof-of-Concept Study,"Ray Hales Hylock, Xiaoming Zeng",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(8):e13592,"Background: Blockchain has the potential to disrupt the current modes of patient data access, accumulation, contribution, exchange, and control. Using interoperability standards, smart contracts, and cryptographic identities, patients can securely exchange data with providers and regulate access. The resulting comprehensive, longitudinal medical records can significantly improve the cost and quality of patient care for individuals and populations alike.Objective: This work presents HealthChain, a novel patient-centered blockchain framework. The intent is to bolster patient engagement, data curation, and regulated dissemination of accumulated information in a secure, interoperable environment. A mixed-block blockchain is proposed to support immutable logging and redactable patient blocks. Patient data are generated and exchanged through Health Level-7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, allowing seamless transfer with compliant systems. In addition, patients receive cryptographic identities in the form of public and private key pairs. Public keys are stored in the blockchain and are suitable for securing and verifying transactions. Furthermore, the envisaged system uses proxy re-encryption (PRE) to share information through revocable, smart contracts, ensuring the preservation of privacy and confidentiality. Finally, several PRE improvements are offered to enhance performance and security.Methods: The framework was formulated to address key barriers to blockchain adoption in health care, namely, information security, interoperability, data integrity, identity validation, and scalability. It supports 16 configurations through the manipulation of 4 modes. An open-source, proof-of-concept tool was developed to evaluate the performance of the novel patient block components and system configurations. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework and evaluate resource consumption, extensive testing was performed on each of the 16 configurations over a variety of scenarios involving a variable number of existing and imported records.Results: The results indicate several clear high-performing, low-bandwidth configurations, although they are not the strongest cryptographically. Of the strongest models, one’s anticipated cumulative record size is shown to influence the selection. Although the most efficient algorithm is ultimately user specific, Advanced Encryption Standard–encrypted data with static keys, incremental server storage, and no additional server-side encryption are the fastest and least bandwidth intensive, whereas proxy re-encrypted data with dynamic keys, incremental server storage, and additional server-side encryption are the best performing of the strongest configurations.Conclusions: Blockchain is a potent and viable technology for patient-centered access to and exchange of health information. By integrating a structured, interoperable design with patient-accumulated and generated data shared through smart contracts into a universally accessible blockchain, HealthChain presents patients and providers with access to consistent and comprehensive medical records. Challenges addressed include data security, interoperability, block storage, and patient-administered data access, with several configurations emerging for further consideration regarding speed and security."
Designing a Distributed Ledger Technology System for Interoperable and General Data Protection Regulation–Compliant Health Data Exchange: A Use Case in Blood Glucose Data,"David Hawig, Chao Zhou, Sebastian Fuhrhop, Andre S Fialho, Navin Ramachandran",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(6):e13665,"Background: Distributed ledger technology (DLT) holds great potential to improve health information exchange. However, the immutable and transparent character of this technology may conflict with data privacy regulations and data processing best practices.Objective: The aim of this paper is to develop a proof-of-concept system for immutable, interoperable, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)–compliant exchange of blood glucose data.Methods: Given that there is no ideal design for a DLT-based patient-provider data exchange solution, we proposed two different variations for our proof-of-concept system. One design was based purely on the public IOTA distributed ledger (a directed acyclic graph-based DLT) and the second used the same public IOTA ledger in combination with a private InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) cluster. Both designs were assessed according to (1) data reversal risk, (2) data linkability risks, (3) processing time, (4) file size compatibility, and (5) overall system complexity.Results: The public IOTA design slightly increased the risk of personal data linkability, had an overall low processing time (requiring mean 6.1, SD 1.9 seconds to upload one blood glucose data sample into the DLT), and was relatively simple to implement. The combination of the public IOTA with a private IPFS cluster minimized both reversal and linkability risks, allowed for the exchange of large files (3 months of blood glucose data were uploaded into the DLT in mean 38.1, SD 13.4 seconds), but involved a relatively higher setup complexity.Conclusions: For the specific use case of blood glucose explored in this study, both designs presented a suitable performance in enabling the interoperable exchange of data between patients and providers. Additionally, both systems were designed considering the latest guidelines on personal data processing, thereby maximizing the alignment with recent GDPR requirements. For future works, these results suggest that the conflict between DLT and data privacy regulations can be addressed if careful considerations are made regarding the use case and the design of the data exchange system."
Blockchain Implementation in Health Care: Protocol for a Systematic Review,"Edward Meinert, Abrar Alturkistani, Kimberley A Foley, Tasnime Osama, Josip Car, Azeem Majeed, Michelle Van Velthoven, Glenn Wells, David Brindley",JMIR Res Protoc 2019;8(2):e10994,"Background: A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, distributed public ledger that acts as a shared and synchronized database that records cryptocurrency transactions. Despite the shift toward digital platforms enabled by electronic medical records, demonstrating a will to reform the health care sector, health systems face issues including security, interoperability, data fragmentation, timely access to patient data, and silos. The application of health care blockchains could enable data interoperability, enhancement of precision medicine, and reduction in prescription frauds through implementing novel methods in access and patient consent.Objective: To summarize the evidence on the strategies and frameworks utilized to implement blockchains for patient data in health care to ensure privacy and improve interoperability and scalability. It is anticipated this review will assist in the development of recommendations that will assist key stakeholders in health care blockchain implementation, and we predict that the evidence generated will challenge the health care status quo, moving away from more traditional approaches and facilitating decision making of patients, health care providers, and researchers.Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest Technology Collection and Engineering Index will be conducted. Two experienced independent reviewers will conduct titles and abstract screening followed by full-text reading to determine study eligibility. Data will then be extracted onto data extraction forms before using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool to appraise the quality of included randomized studies and the Risk of Bias in nonrandomized studies of Interventions to assess the quality of nonrandomized studies. Data will then be analyzed and synthesized.Results: Database searches will be initiated in September 2018. We expect to complete the review in January 2019.Conclusions: This review will summarize the strategies and frameworks used to implement blockchains in health care to increase data privacy, interoperability, and scalability. This review will also help clarify if the strategies and frameworks required for the operationalization of blockchains in health care ensure the privacy of patient data while enabling efficiency, interoperability, and scalability."
Digital Health and the State of Interoperable Electronic Health Records,Jessica Germaine Germaine Shull,JMIR Med Inform 2019;7(4):e12712,"unstructured: Digital health systems and innovative care delivery within these systems have great potential to improve national health care and positively impact the health outcomes of patients. However, currently, very few countries have systems that can implement digital interventions at scale. This is partly because of the lack of interoperable electronic health records (EHRs). It is difficult to make decisions for an individual or population when the data on that person or population are dispersed over multiple incompatible systems. 
This viewpoint paper has highlighted some key obstacles of current EHRs and some promising successes, with the goal of promoting EHR evolution and advocating for frameworks that develop digital health systems that serve populations—a critical goal as we move further into this data-rich century with an ever-increasing number of patients who live longer and depend on health care services where resources may already be strained.
This paper aimed to analyze the evolution, obstacles, and current landscape of EHRs and identify fundamental areas of hindrance for interoperability. It also aimed to highlight countries where advances have been made and extract best practices from these examples.
The obstacles to EHR interoperability are not easily solved, but improving the current situation in countries where a national policy is not in place will require a focused inquiry into solutions from various sources in the public and private sector.
Effort must be made on a national scale to seek solutions for optimally interoperable EHRs beyond status quo solutions. A list of considerations for best practices is suggested."
Attitudes Toward Blockchain Technology in Managing Medical Information: Survey Study,"Yong Sauk Hau, Jae Min Lee, Jaechan Park, Min Cheol Chang",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(12):e15870,"Background: The recently developed blockchain technology uses a peer-to-peer network to distribute data to all participants for storage. This method enhances data safety, reliability, integrity, and transparency. To successfully introduce blockchain technology to medical data management, it is essential to obtain consent from medical doctors and patients.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine medical doctors’ and patients’ attitudes toward the use of blockchain technology and interpret the findings within the framework of expectancy theory.Methods: In this questionnaire survey, we examined medical doctors’ (n=90) and patients’ (n=90) attitudes toward the use of blockchain technology in the management and distribution of medical information. The questionnaire comprised 8 questions that assessed attitudes toward new means of managing and distributing medical information using blockchain technology. Responses were rated on a scale that ranged from 1 (very negative) to 7 (very positive).Results: Medical doctors (mean 3.7-5.0) reported significantly more negative attitudes than patients (mean 6.3-6.8). Furthermore, self-employed doctors reported more negative attitudes than employed doctors and university professors.Conclusions: To successfully introduce blockchain technology to medical data management, it is necessary to promote positive attitudes toward this technology among medical doctors, especially self-employed doctors."
Secure and Scalable mHealth Data Management Using Blockchain Combined With Client Hashchain: System Design and Validation,"Tomomitsu Motohashi, Tomonobu Hirano, Kosuke Okumura, Makiko Kashiyama, Daisuke Ichikawa, Taro Ueno",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(5):e13385,"Background: Blockchain is emerging as an innovative technology for secure data management in many areas, including medical practice. A distributed blockchain network is tolerant against network fault, and the registered data are resistant to tampering and revision. The technology has a high affinity with digital medicine like mobile health (mHealth) and provides reliability to the medical data without labor-intensive third-party contributions. On the other hand, the reliability of the medical data is not insured before registration to the blockchain network. Furthermore, there are issues with regard to how the clients' mobile devices should be dealt with and authenticated in the blockchain network in order to avoid impersonation.Objective: The aim of the study was to design and validate an mHealth system that enables the compatibility of the security and scalability of the medical data using blockchain technology.Methods: We designed an mHealth system that sends medical data to the blockchain network via relay servers. The architecture provides scalability and convenience of operation of the system. In order to ensure the reliability of the data from clients' mobile devices, hash values with chain structure (client hashchain) were calculated in the clients' devices and the results were registered on the blockchain network.Results: The system was applied and deployed in mHealth for insomnia treatment. Clinical trials for mHealth were conducted with insomnia patients. Medical data of the recruited patients were successfully registered with the blockchain network via relay servers along with the hashchain calculated on the clients' mobile devices. The correctness of the data was validated by identifying illegal data, which were made by simulating fraudulent access.Conclusions: Our proposed mHealth system, blockchain combined with client hashchain, ensures compatibility of security and scalability in the data management of mHealth medical practice.Trial Registration: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000032951; https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open- bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000037564 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/78HP5iFIw)"
Benefits of Blockchain Initiatives for Value-Based Care: Proposed Framework,"Rongen Zhang, Amrita George, Jongwoo Kim, Veneetia Johnson, Balasubramaniam Ramesh",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(9):e13595,"Background: The potential of blockchain technology to achieve strategic goals, such as value-based care, is increasingly being recognized by both researchers and practitioners. However, current research and practices lack comprehensive approaches for evaluating the benefits of blockchain applications.Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a framework for holistically assessing the performance of blockchain initiatives in providing value-based care by extending the existing balanced scorecard (BSC) evaluation framework.Methods: Based on a review of the literature on value-based health care, blockchain technology, and methods for evaluating initiatives in disruptive technologies, we propose an extended BSC method for holistically evaluating blockchain applications in the provision of value-based health care. The proposed method extends the BSC framework, which has been extensively used to measure both financial and nonfinancial performance of organizations. The usefulness of our proposed framework is further demonstrated via a case study.Results: We describe the extended BSC framework, which includes five perspectives (both financial and nonfinancial) from which to assess the appropriateness and performance of blockchain initiatives in the health care domain.Conclusions: The proposed framework moves us toward a holistic evaluation of both the financial and nonfinancial benefits of blockchain initiatives in the context of value-based care and its provision."
Design Choices and Trade-Offs in Health Care Blockchain Implementations: Systematic Review,"Odhran O'Donoghue, Anuraag A Vazirani, David Brindley, Edward Meinert",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(5):e12426,"Background: A blockchain is a list of records that uses cryptography to make stored data immutable; their use has recently been proposed for electronic medical record (EMR) systems. This paper details a systematic review of trade-offs in blockchain technologies that are relevant to EMRs. Trade-offs are defined as “a compromise between two desirable but incompatible features.”Objective: This review’s primary research question was: “What are the trade-offs involved in different blockchain designs that are relevant to the creation of blockchain-based electronic medical records systems?”Methods: Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Papers published from January 1, 2017 to June 15, 2018 were selected. Quality assessments of papers were performed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies—of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the Critical Assessment Skills Programme (CASP) tool. Database searches identified 2885 articles, of which 15 were ultimately included for analysis.Results: A total of 17 trade-offs were identified impacting the design, development, and implementation of blockchain systems; these trade-offs are organized into themes, including business, application, data, and technology architecture.Conclusions: The key findings concluded the following: (1) multiple trade-offs can be managed adaptively to improve EMR utility; (2) multiple trade-offs involve improving the security of blockchain systems at the cost of other features, meaning EMR efficacy highly depends on data protection standards; and (3) multiple trade-offs result in improved blockchain scalability. Consideration of these trade-offs will be important to the specific environment in which electronic medical records are being developed. This review also uses its findings to suggest useful design choices for a hypothetical National Health Service blockchain.registered-report: RR2-10.2196/10994"

The project was conducted to demonstrate clinical data management using blockchain technology under the regulatory sandbox enabled by the Japanese Cabinet Office.Results: We verified and validated the data in the clinical trial using the validation protocol and tested its resilience to data tampering. The robustness of the system was also proven by survival with zero downtime for clinical data registration during a Amazon Web Services disruption event in the Tokyo region on August 23, 2019.Conclusions: We show that our system can improve clinical trial data management, enhance trust in the clinical research process, and ease regulator burden. The system will contribute to the sustainability of health care services through the optimization of cost for clinical trials."
Examining the Potential of Blockchain Technology to Meet the Needs of 21st-Century Japanese Health Care: Viewpoint on Use Cases and Policy,"Tim Ken Mackey, Hirofumi Bekki, Tokio Matsuzaki, Hiroshi Mizushima",J Med Internet Res 2020;22(1):e13649,"unstructured: Japan is undergoing a major population health transition as its society ages, and it continues to experience low birth rates. An aging Japan will bring new challenges to its public health system, highlighted as a model for universal health coverage (UHC) around the world. Specific challenges Japan’s health care system will face include an increase in national public health expenditures, higher demand for health care services, acute need for elder and long-term care, shortage of health care workers, and disparities between health care access in rural versus urban areas. Blockchain technology has the potential to address some of these challenges, but only if a health blockchain is conceptualized, designed, localized, and deployed in a way that is compatible with Japan’s centralized UHC-centric public health system. Blockchain solutions must also be adaptive to opportunities and barriers unique to Japan’s national health and innovation policy, including its regulatory sandbox system, while also seeking to learn from blockchain adoption in the private sector and in other countries. This viewpoint outlines the major opportunities and potential challenges to blockchain adoption for the future of Japan’s health care."
Using Blockchain Technology to Manage Clinical Trials Data: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"David M Maslove, Jacob Klein, Kathryn Brohman, Patrick Martin",JMIR Med Inform 2018;6(4):e11949,"Background: Blockchain technology is emerging as an innovative tool in data and software security.Objective: This study aims to explore the role of blockchain in supporting clinical trials data management and develop a proof-of-concept implementation of a patient-facing and researcher-facing system.Methods: Blockchain-based Smart Contracts were built using the Ethereum platform.Results: We described BlockTrial, a system that uses a Web-based interface to allow users to run trials-related Smart Contracts on an Ethereum network. Functions allow patients to grant researchers access to their data and allow researchers to submit queries for data that are stored off chain. As a type of distributed ledger, the system generates a durable and transparent log of these and other transactions. BlockTrial could be used to increase the trustworthiness of data collected during clinical research with benefits to researchers, regulators, and drug companies alike. In addition, the system could empower patients to become more active and fully informed partners in research.Conclusions: Blockchain technology presents an opportunity to address some of the common threats to the integrity of data collected in clinical trials and ensure that the analysis of these data comply with prespecified plans. Further technical work is needed to add additional functions. Policies must be developed to determine the optimal models for participation in the system by its various stakeholders."
The Potential of Blockchain Technology for Health Information Exchange: Experimental Study From Patients’ Perspectives,"Pouyan Esmaeilzadeh, Tala Mirzaei",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(6):e14184,"Background: Nowadays, a number of mechanisms and tools are being used by health care organizations and physicians to electronically exchange the personal health information of patients. The main objectives of different methods of health information exchange (HIE) are to reduce health care costs, minimize medical errors, and improve the coordination of interorganizational information exchange across health care entities. The main challenges associated with the common HIE systems are privacy concerns, security risks, low visibility of system transparency, and lack of patient control. Blockchain technology is likely to disrupt the current information exchange models utilized in the health care industry.Objective: Little is known about patients’ perceptions and attitudes toward the implementation of blockchain-enabled HIE networks, and it is still not clear if patients (as one of the main HIE stakeholders) are likely to opt in to the applications of this technology in HIE initiatives. Thus, this study aimed at exploring the core value of blockchain technology in the health care industry from health care consumers’ views.Methods: To recognize the potential applications of blockchain technology in health care practices, we designed 16 information exchange scenarios for controlled Web-based experiments. Overall, 2013 respondents participated in 16 Web-based experiments. Each experiment described an information exchange condition characterized by 4 exchange mechanisms (ie, direct, lookup, patient-centered, and blockchain), 2 types of health information (ie, sensitive vs nonsensitive), and 2 types of privacy policy (weak vs strong).Results: The findings show that there are significant differences in patients’ perceptions of various exchange mechanisms with regard to patient privacy concern, trust in competency and integrity, opt-in intention, and willingness to share information. Interestingly, participants hold a favorable attitude toward the implementation of blockchain-based exchange mechanisms for privacy protection, coordination, and information exchange purposes. This study proposed the potentials and limitations of a blockchain-based attempt in the HIE context.Conclusions: The results of this research should be of interest to both academics and practitioners. The findings propose potential limitations of a blockchain-based HIE that should be addressed by health care organizations to exchange personal health information in a secure and private manner. This study can contribute to the research in the blockchain area and enrich the literature on the use of blockchain in HIE efforts. Practitioners can also identify how to leverage the benefit of blockchain to promote HIE initiatives nationwide."
Is Blockchain Technology Suitable for Managing Personal Health Records? Mixed-Methods Study to Test Feasibility,"Yu Rang Park, Eunsol Lee, Wonjun Na, Sungjun Park, Yura Lee, Jae-Ho Lee",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(2):e12533,"Background: There are many perspectives on the advantages of introducing blockchain in the medical field, but there are no published feasibility studies regarding the storage, propagation, and management of personal health records (PHRs) using blockchain technology.Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of blockchains in the medical field in relation to transactions with and propagation of PHRs in a private blockchain.Methods: We constructed a private blockchain network using Ethereum version 1.8.4 and conducted verification using the de-identified PHRs of 300 patients. The private blockchain network consisted of one hospital node and 300 patient nodes. In order to verify the effectiveness of blockchain-based PHR management, PHRs at a time were loaded in a transaction between the hospital and patient nodes and propagated to the whole network. We obtained and analyzed the time and gas required for data transaction and propagation on the blockchain network. For reproducibility, these processes were repeated 100 times.Results: Of 300 patient records, 74 (24.7%) were not loaded in the private blockchain due to the data block size of the transaction block. The remaining 226 individual health records were classified into groups A (80 patients with outpatient visit data less than 1 year old), B (84 patients with outpatient data from between 1 and 3 years before data collection), and C (62 patients with outpatient data 3 to 5 years old). With respect to mean transaction time in the blockchain, C (128.7 seconds) had the shortest time, followed by A (132.2 seconds) and then B (159.0 seconds). The mean propagation times for groups A, B, and C were 1494.2 seconds, 2138.9 seconds, and 4111.4 seconds, respectively; mean file sizes were 5.6 KB, 18.6 KB, and 45.38 KB, respectively. The mean gas consumption values were 1,900,767; 4,224,341; and 4,112,784 for groups A, B, and C, respectively.Conclusions: This study confirms that it is possible to exchange PHR data in a private blockchain network. However, to develop a blockchain-based PHR platform that can be used in practice, many improvements are required, including reductions in data size, improved personal information protection, and reduced operating costs."
Application of a Blockchain Platform to Manage and Secure Personal Genomic Data: A Case Study of LifeCODE.ai in China,"Xiao-Ling Jin, Miao Zhang, Zhongyun Zhou, Xiaoyu Yu",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(9):e13587,"Background: The rapid development of genetic and genomic technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and genome editing, has made disease treatment much more precise and effective. The technologies’ value can only be realized by the aggregation and analysis of people’s genomic and health data. However, the collection and sharing of genomic data has many obstacles, including low data quality, information islands, tampering distortions, missing records, leaking of private data, and gray data transactions.Objective: This study aimed to prove that emerging blockchain technology provides a solution for the protection and management of sensitive personal genomic data because of its decentralization, traceability, encryption algorithms, and antitampering features.Methods: This paper describes the case of a blockchain-based genomic big data platform, LifeCODE.ai, to illustrate the means by which blockchain enables the storage and management of genomic data from the perspectives of data ownership, data sharing, and data security.Results: Blockchain opens up new avenues for dealing with data ownership, data sharing, and data security issues in genomic big data platforms and realizes the psychological empowerment of individuals in the platform.Conclusions: The blockchain platform provides new possibilities for the management and security of genetic data and can help realize the psychological empowerment of individuals in the process, and consequently, the effects of data self-governance, incentive-sharing, and security improvement can be achieved. However, there are still some problems in the blockchain that have not been solved, and which require continuous in-depth research and innovation in the future."
Tamper-Resistant Mobile Health Using Blockchain Technology,"Daisuke Ichikawa, Makiko Kashiyama, Taro Ueno",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2017;5(7):e111,"Background: Digital health technologies, including telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), and remote monitoring, are playing a greater role in medical practice. Safe and accurate management of medical information leads to the advancement of digital health, which in turn results in a number of beneficial effects. Furthermore, mHealth can help lower costs by facilitating the delivery of care and connecting people to their health care providers. Mobile apps help empower patients and health care providers to proactively address medical conditions through near real-time monitoring and treatment, regardless of the location of the patient or the health care provider. Additionally, mHealth data are stored in servers, and consequently, data management that prevents all forms of manipulation is crucial for both medical practice and clinical trials.Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a tamper-resistant mHealth system using blockchain technology, which enables trusted and auditable computing using a decentralized network.Methods: We developed an mHealth system for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia using a smartphone app. The volunteer data collected with the app were stored in JavaScript Object Notation format and sent to the blockchain network. Thereafter, we evaluated the tamper resistance of the data against the inconsistencies caused by artificial faults.Results: Electronic medical records collected using smartphones were successfully sent to a private Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. We verified the data update process under conditions where all the validating peers were running normally. The mHealth data were successfully updated under network faults. We further ensured that any electronic health record registered to the blockchain network was resistant to tampering and revision. The mHealth data update was compatible with tamper resistance in the blockchain network.Conclusions: Blockchain serves as a tamperproof system for mHealth. Combining mHealth with blockchain technology may provide a novel solution that enables both accessibility and data transparency without a third party such as a contract research organization."
Using Blockchain Technology to Mitigate Challenges in Service Access for the Homeless and Data Exchange Between Providers: Qualitative Study,"Anjum Khurshid, Vivian Rajeswaren, Steven Andrews",J Med Internet Res 2020;22(6):e16887,"Background: In the homeless population, barriers to housing and supportive services include a lack of control or access to data. Disparate data formats and storage across multiple organizations hinder up-to-date intersystem access to records and a unified view of an individual’s health and documentation history. The utility of blockchain to solve interoperability in health care is supported in recent literature, but the technology has yet to be tested in real-life conditions encompassing the complex regulatory standards in the health sector.Objective: This study aimed to test the feasibility and performance of a blockchain system in a homeless community to securely store and share data across a system of providers in the health care ecosystem.Methods: We performed a series of platform demonstrations and open-ended qualitative feedback interviews to determine the key needs and barriers to user and stakeholder adoption. Account creation and data transactions promoting organizational efficiency and improved health outcomes in this population were tested with homeless users and service providers.Results: Persons experiencing homelessness and care organizations could successfully create accounts, grant and revoke data sharing permissions, and transmit documents across a distributed network of providers. However, there were issues regarding the security of shared data, user experience and adoption, and organizational preparedness for service providers as end users. We tested a set of assumptions related to these problems within the project time frame and contractual obligations with an existing blockchain-based platform.Conclusions: Blockchain technology provides decentralized data sharing, validation, immutability, traceability, and integration. These core features enable a secure system for the management and distribution of sensitive information. This study presents a concrete evaluation of the effectiveness of blockchain through an existing platform while revealing limitations from the perspectives of user adoption, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and regulatory frameworks."
Cloud Health Resource Sharing Based on Consensus-Oriented Blockchain Technology: Case Study on a Breast Tumor Diagnosis Service,"Xiaobao Zhu, Jing Shi, Cuiyuan Lu",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(7):e13767,"Background: In recent years, researchers have made significant efforts in advancing blockchain technology. This technology, with distinct features of decentralization and security, can be applied to many fields. In areas of health data and resource sharing, applications of blockchain technology are also emerging.Objective: In this study, we propose a cloud health resource-sharing model based on consensus-oriented blockchain technology and have developed a simulation study on breast tumor diagnosis.Methods: The proposed platform is built on a consortium or federated blockchain that possesses features of both centralization and decentralization. The consensus mechanisms generate operating standards for the proposed model. Open source Ethereum code is employed to provide the blockchain environment. Proof of Authority is selected as the consensus algorithm of block generation.Results: Based on the proposed model, a simulation case study for breast tumor classification is constructed. The simulation includes 9893 service requests from 100 users; 22 service providers are equipped with 22 different classification methods. Each request is fulfilled by a service provider recommended by the weighted k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The majority of service requests are handled by 9 providers, and provider service evaluation scores tend to stabilize. Also, user priority on KNN weights significantly affects the system operation outcome.Conclusions: The proposed model is feasible based on the simulation case study for the cloud service of breast tumor diagnosis and has the potential to be applied to other applications."
Supporting Heart Failure Patient Transitions From Acute to Community Care With Home Telemonitoring Technology: A Protocol for a Provincial Randomized Controlled Trial (TEC4Home),Lynn TEC4Home Healthcare Innovation Community,JMIR Res Protoc 2016;5(4):e198,"Background: Seniors with chronic diseases such as heart failure have complex care needs. They are vulnerable to their condition deteriorating and, without timely intervention, may require multiple emergency department visits and/or repeated hospitalizations. Upon discharge, the transition from the emergency department to home can be a vulnerable time for recovering patients with disruptions in the continuity of care. Remote monitoring of heart failure patients using home telemonitoring, coupled with clear communication protocols between health care professionals, can be effective in increasing the safety and quality of care for seniors with heart failure discharged from the emergency department.Objective: The aim of the Telehealth for Emergency-Community Continuity of Care Connectivity via Home Telemonitoring (TEC4Home) study is to generate evidence through a programmatic evaluation and a clinical trial to determine how home telemonitoring may improve care and increase patient safety during the transition of care and determine how it is best implemented to support patients with heart failure within this context.Methods: This 4-year project consists of 3 studies to comprehensively evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of TEC4Home. Study 1 is a feasibility study with 90 patients recruited from 2 emergency department sites to test implementation and evaluation procedures. Findings from the feasibility study will be used to refine protocols for the larger trial. Study 2 is a cluster randomized controlled trial that will include 30 emergency department sites and 900 patients across British Columbia. The primary outcome of the randomized controlled trial will be emergency department revisits and hospital readmission rates. Secondary outcomes include health care resource utilization/costs, communication between members of the care team, and patient quality of life. Study 3 will run concurrently to study 2 and test the effectiveness of predictive analytic software to detect patient deterioration sooner.Results: It is hypothesized that TEC4Home will be a cost-effective strategy to decrease 90-day emergency department revisits and hospital admission rates and improve comfort and quality of life for seniors with heart failure. The results from this project will also help establish an innovation pathway for rapid and rigorous introduction of innovation into the health system.Conclusions: While there is some evidence about the effectiveness of home telemonitoring for some patients and conditions, the TEC4Home project will be one of the first protocols that implements and evaluates the technology for patients with heart failure as they transition from the emergency department to home care. The results from this research are expected to inform the full scale and spread of the home monitoring approach throughout British Columbia and Canada and to other chronic diseases.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02821065; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02821065 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6ml2iwKax)"
Using Blockchain to Create Transaction Identity for Persons Experiencing Homelessness in America: Policy Proposal,"Anjum Khurshid, Ashish Gadnis",JMIR Res Protoc 2019;8(3):e10654,"unstructured: More than 500,000 people experience homelessness in America each day. Local and federal solutions to the problem have had limited success because of the fragmentation of services and lack of valid and timely information. Billions of dollars spent to provide reliable, timely, and actionable information in health care have exposed the difficulty of establishing such a system using the prevalent information technology solutions. However, relying on successful examples of the use of blockchain to help refugee populations and poor farmers internationally, we have partnered to propose an innovative solution to this problem using the case of people experiencing homelessness in Austin, Texas. This paper aims to describe one of the first applications of blockchain technology for addressing homelessness in the United States by creating a digital identity for people experiencing homelessness and engaging emergency medical services and clinical providers. The authors argue that a lack of documentation to prove personal identity and the inability to access own records are major hurdles for empowering persons experiencing homelessness to be resilient and overcome the life challenges they face. Furthermore, it is argued that this lack of information causes misdiagnosis, duplication, and fragmentation in service delivery, which can be potentially addressed by blockchain technology. Further planning for creating a program on the ground with additional funding will demonstrate the results of using blockchain technology to establish digital identity for persons experiencing homelessness."
Blockchain-Enabled iWellChain Framework Integration With the National Medical Referral System: Development and Usability Study,"Yu-Sheng Lo, Cheng-Yi Yang, Hsiung-Fei Chien, Shy-Shin Chang, Chung-Ying Lu, Ray-Jade Chen",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(12):e13563,"Background: Medical referral is the transfer of a patient’s care from one physician to another upon request. This process involves multiple steps that require provider-to-provider and provider-to-patient communication. In Taiwan, the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) has implemented a national medical referral (NMR) system, which encourages physicians to refer their patients to different health care facilities to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and the financial stress on the national health insurance. However, the NHIA’s NMR system is a government-based electronic medical referral service, and its referral data access and exchange are limited to authorized clinical professionals using their national health smart cards over the NHIA virtual private network. Therefore, this system lacks scalability and flexibility and cannot establish trusting relationships among patients, family doctors, and specialists.Objective: To eliminate the existing restrictions of the NHIA’s NMR system, this study developed a scalable, flexible, and blockchain-enabled framework that leverages the NHIA’s NMR referral data to build an alliance-based medical referral service connecting health care facilities.Methods: We developed a blockchain-enabled framework that can integrate patient referral data from the NHIA’s NMR system with electronic medical record (EMR) and electronic health record (EHR) data of hospitals and community-based clinics to establish an alliance-based medical referral service serving patients, clinics, and hospitals and improve the trust in relationships and transaction security. We also developed a blockchain-enabled personal health record decentralized app (DApp) based on our blockchain-enabled framework for patients to acquire their EMR and EHR data; DApp access logs were collected to assess patients’ behavior and investigate the acceptance of our personal authorization-controlled framework.Results: The constructed iWellChain Framework was installed in an affiliated teaching hospital and four collaborative clinics. The framework renders all medical referral processes automatic and paperless and facilitates efficient NHIA reimbursements. In addition, the blockchain-enabled iWellChain DApp was distributed for patients to access and control their EMR and EHR data. Analysis of 3 months (September to December 2018) of access logs revealed that patients were highly interested in acquiring health data, especially those of laboratory test reports.Conclusions: This study is a pioneer of blockchain applications for medical referral services, and the constructed framework and DApp have been applied practically in clinical settings. The iWellChain Framework has the scalability to deploy a blockchain environment effectively for health care facilities; the iWellChain DApp has potential for use with more patient-centered applications to collaborate with the industry and facilitate its adoption."
"Conversational Interfaces for Health: Bibliometric Analysis of Grants, Publications, and Patents","Zhaopeng Xing, Fei Yu, Jian Du, Jennifer S. Walker, Claire B. Paulson, Nandita S. Mani, Lixin Song",J Med Internet Res 2019;21(11):e14672,"Background: Conversational interfaces (CIs) in different modalities have been developed for health purposes, such as health behavioral intervention, patient self-management, and clinical decision support. Despite growing research evidence supporting CIs’ potential, CI-related research is still in its infancy. There is a lack of systematic investigation that goes beyond publication review and presents the state of the art from perspectives of funding agencies, academia, and industry by incorporating CI-related public funding and patent activities.Objective: This study aimed to use data systematically extracted from multiple sources (ie, grant, publication, and patent databases) to investigate the development, research, and fund application of health-related CIs and associated stakeholders (ie, countries, organizations, and collaborators).Methods: A multifaceted search query was executed to retrieve records from 9 databases. Bibliometric analysis, social network analysis, and term co-occurrence analysis were conducted on the screened records.Results: This review included 42 funded projects, 428 research publications, and 162 patents. The total dollar amount of grants awarded was US $30,297,932, of which US $13,513,473 was awarded by US funding agencies and US $16,784,459 was funded by the Europe Commission. The top 3 funding agencies in the United States were the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Boston Medical Center was awarded the largest combined grant size (US $2,246,437) for 4 projects. The authors of the publications were from 58 countries and 566 organizations; the top 3 most productive organizations were Northeastern University (United States), Universiti Teknologi MARA (Malaysia), and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS; France). US researchers produced 114 publications. Although 82.0% (464/566) of the organizations engaged in interorganizational collaboration, 2 organizational research-collaboration clusters were observed with Northeastern University and CNRS as the central nodes. About 112 organizations from the United States and China filed 87.7% patents. IBM filed most patents (N=17). Only 5 patents were co-owned by different organizations, and there was no across-country collaboration on patenting activity. The terms patient, child, elderly, and robot were frequently discussed in the 3 record types. The terms related to mental and chronic issues were discussed mainly in grants and publications. The terms regarding multimodal interactions were widely mentioned as users’ communication modes with CIs in the identified records.Conclusions: Our findings provided an overview of the countries, organizations, and topic terms in funded projects, as well as the authorship, collaboration, content, and related information of research publications and patents. There is a lack of broad cross-sector partnerships among grant agencies, academia, and industry, particularly in the United States. Our results suggest a need to improve collaboration among public and private sectors and health care organizations in research and patent activities."
The Impact of a Social Networking Service–Enhanced Smart Care Model on Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease: Quasi-Experimental Study,"Feng-Jung Yang, Ying-Hui Hou, Ray-E Chang",J Med Internet Res 2020;22(4):e15565,"Background: Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a high risk for dialysis initiation and for complications such as uremic encephalopathy, uremic symptoms, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infection. One of the most common barriers to health care for patients with stage 5 CKD is poor continuity of care due to unresolved communication gaps.Objective: Our aim was to establish a powerful care model that includes the use of a social networking service (SNS) to improve care quality for patients with CKD and safely delay dialysis initiation.Methods: We used a retrospective cohort of CKD patients aged 20-85 years who received care between 2007 and 2017 to evaluate the efficacy of incorporating an SNS into the health care system. In 2014, author F-JY, a nephrologist at the National Taiwan University Hospital Yunlin Branch, started to use an SNS app to connect with stage 5 CKD patients and their families. In cases of emergency, patients and families could quickly report any condition to F-JY. Using this app, F-JY helped facilitate productive interactions between these patients and the health care system. The intention was to safely delay the initiation of dialysis therapy. We divided patients into four groups: group 1 (G1) included patients at the study hospital during the 2007-2014 period who had contact only with nephrologists other than F-JY; group 2 (G2) included patients who visited F-JY during the 2007-2014 period before he began using the SNS app; group 3 (G3) included patients who visited nephrologists other than F-JY during the 2014-2017 period and had no interactions using the SNS; and group 4 (G4) included patients who visited F-JY during the 2014-2017 period and interacted with him using the SNS app.Results: We recruited 209 patients with stage 5 CKD who had been enrolled in the study hospital’s CKD program between 2007 and 2017. Each of the four groups initiated dialysis at different times. Before adjusting for baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the G4 patients had a longer time to dialysis (mean 761.7 days, SD 616.2 days) than the other groups (G1: mean 403.6 days, SD 409.4 days, P=.011 for G4 vs G1; G2: 394.8 days, SD 318.8 days, P=.04; G3: 369.1 days, SD 330.8 days, P=.049). After adjusting for baseline eGFR, G4 had a longer duration for each eGFR drop (mean 84.8 days, SD 65.1 days) than the other groups (G1: mean 43.5 days, SD 45.4 days, P=.005; G2: mean 42.5 days, SD 26.5 days, P=.03; G3: mean 3.8.7 days, SD 33.5 days, P=.002).Conclusions: The use of an SNS app between patients with stage 5 CKD and their physicians can reduce the communication gap between them and create benefits such as prolonging time-to-dialysis initiation. The role of SNSs and associated care models should be further investigated in a larger population."
Easier and Faster Is Not Always Better: Grounded Theory of the Impact of Large-Scale System Transformation on the Clinical Work of Emergency Medicine Nurses and Physicians,"Elaine Merle Zibrowski, Lisa Shepherd, Kamran Sedig, Richard Booth, Candace Gibson",JMIR Hum Factors 2018;5(4):e11013,"Background: The effectiveness of Lean Thinking as a quality improvement method for health care has been contested due, in part, to our limited contextual understanding of how it affects the working conditions and clinical workflow of nurses and physicians. Although there are some initial indications, arising from prevalence surveys and interviews, that Lean may intensify work performed within medical environments, the evidence base still requires detailed descriptions of the changes that were actually introduced to individuals’ clinical workflow and how these changes impacted health care professionals.Objective: The aim of this study was to explore ways in which a Lean intervention may impact the clinical work of emergency medicine nurses and physicians.Methods: We used a realist grounded theory approach to explore the clinical work of nurses and physicians practicing in 2 emergency medicine departments from a single teaching hospital in Canada. The hospital has 1000 beds with 128,000 emergency department (ED) visits annually. In 2013, both sites began a large-scale, Lean-driven system transformation of their practice environments. In-person interviews were iteratively conducted with health care professionals from July to December 2017. Information from transcripts was coded into categories and compared with existing codes. With repeated review of transcripts and evolving coding, we organized categories into themes. Data collection continued to theoretical sufficiency.Results: A total of 15 emergency medicine nurses and 5 physicians were interviewed. Of these, 18 individuals had practiced for at least 10 years. Our grounded theory involved 3 themes: (1) organization of our clinical work, (2) pushed pace in the front cell, and (3) the toll this all takes on us. Although the intervention was supposed to make the EDs work easier, faster, and better, the participants in our study indicated that the changes made had the opposite impact. Nurses and physicians described ways in which the reconfigured EDs disrupted their established practice routines and resulted in the intensification of their work. Participants also identified indications of deskilling of nurses’ work and how the new push-forward model of patient care had detrimental impacts on their physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the impact of Lean health care on the working conditions and actual work of emergency medicine nurses and physicians. We theorize that rather than support health care professionals in their management of the complexities that characterize emergency medicine, the physical and process-based changes introduced by the Lean intervention acted to further complicate their working environment. We have illuminated some unintended consequences associated with accelerating patient flow on the clinical workflow and perceived well-being of health care professionals. We identify some areas for reconsideration by the departments and put forward ideas for future research."
Blockchain Technology for Detecting Falsified and Substandard Drugs in Distribution: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Intervention,"Patrick Garcia Sylim, Fang Liu, Alvin Marcelo, Paul Fontelo",JMIR Res Protoc 2018;7(9):e10163,"Background: Drug counterfeiting is a global problem with significant risks to consumers and the general public. In the Philippines, 30% of inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the public to check the certificates of product registration and report any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found. Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information sharing along the official drug distribution network.Objective: This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system and test its functions in a simulated network.Methods: We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and the consumer portal.Results: Development is underway. The design of the system will place FDA in a supervisory data verification role, with each pedigree type–specific data source serving a primary data verification role. The supply chain process will be initiated by the manufacturer, with recursive verification for every transaction. It will allow consumers to scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug distribution history.Conclusions: Development and testing will be conducted in a simulated network, and thus, results may differ from actual practice. The project being proposed is disruptive; once tested, the team intends to engage the Philippine FDA to discuss implementation plans and formulate policies to facilitate adoption and sustainability.registered-report: RR1-10.2196/10163"
Blockchain-Authenticated Sharing of Genomic and Clinical Outcomes Data of Patients With Cancer: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Benjamin Scott Glicksberg, Shohei Burns, Rob Currie, Ann Griffin, Zhen Jane Wang, David Haussler, Theodore Goldstein, Eric Collisson",J Med Internet Res 2020;22(3):e16810,"Background: Efficiently sharing health data produced during standard care could dramatically accelerate progress in cancer treatments, but various barriers make this difficult. Not sharing these data to ensure patient privacy is at the cost of little to no learning from real-world data produced during cancer care. Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated a willingness of patients with cancer to share their treatment experiences to fuel research, despite potential risks to privacy.Objective: The objective of this study was to design, pilot, and release a decentralized, scalable, efficient, economical, and secure strategy for the dissemination of deidentified clinical and genomic data with a focus on late-stage cancer.Methods: We created and piloted a blockchain-authenticated system to enable secure sharing of deidentified patient data derived from standard of care imaging, genomic testing, and electronic health records (EHRs), called the Cancer Gene Trust (CGT). We prospectively consented and collected data for a pilot cohort (N=18), which we uploaded to the CGT. EHR data were extracted from both a hospital cancer registry and a common data model (CDM) format to identify optimal data extraction and dissemination practices. Specifically, we scored and compared the level of completeness between two EHR data extraction formats against the gold standard source documentation for patients with available data (n=17).Results: Although the total completeness scores were greater for the registry reports than those for the CDM, this difference was not statistically significant. We did find that some specific data fields, such as histology site, were better captured using the registry reports, which can be used to improve the continually adapting CDM. In terms of the overall pilot study, we found that CGT enables rapid integration of real-world data of patients with cancer in a more clinically useful time frame. We also developed an open-source Web application to allow users to seamlessly search, browse, explore, and download CGT data.Conclusions: Our pilot demonstrates the willingness of patients with cancer to participate in data sharing and how blockchain-enabled structures can maintain relationships between individual data elements while preserving patient privacy, empowering findings by third-party researchers and clinicians. We demonstrate the feasibility of CGT as a framework to share health data trapped in silos to further cancer research. Further studies to optimize data representation, stream, and integrity are required."
Rethinking Data Sharing at the Dawn of a Health Data Economy: A Viewpoint,"Chunlei Tang, Joseph M Plasek, David W. Bates",J Med Internet Res 2018;20(11):e11519,"unstructured: A health data economy has begun to form, but its rise has been tempered by the profound lack of sharing of both data and data products such as models, intermediate results, and annotated training corpora, and this severely limits the potential for triggering economic cluster effects. Economic cluster effects represent a means to elicit benefit from economies of scale from internal data innovations and are beneficial because they may mitigate challenges from external sources. Within institutions, data product sharing is needed to spark data entrepreneurship and data innovation, and cross-institutional sharing is also critical, especially for rare conditions."
Reimagining Health Data Exchange: An Application Programming Interface–Enabled Roadmap for India,"Satchit Balsari, Alexander Fortenko, Joaquín A. Blaya, Adrian Gropper, Malavika Jayaram, Rahul Matthan, Ram Sahasranam, Mark Shankar, Suptendra N Sarbadhikari, Barbara E Bierer, Kenneth D Mandl, Sanjay Mehendale, Tarun Khanna",J Med Internet Res 2018;20(7):e10725,"unstructured: In February 2018, the Government of India announced a massive public health insurance scheme extending coverage to 500 million citizens, in effect making it the world’s largest insurance program. To meet this target, the government will rely on technology to effectively scale services, monitor quality, and ensure accountability. While India has seen great strides in informational technology development and outsourcing, cellular phone penetration, cloud computing, and financial technology, the digital health ecosystem is in its nascent stages and has been waiting for a catalyst to seed the system. This National Health Protection Scheme is expected to provide just this impetus for widespread adoption. However, health data in India are mostly not digitized. In the few instances that they are, the data are not standardized, not interoperable, and not readily accessible to clinicians, researchers, or policymakers. While such barriers to easy health information exchange are hardly unique to India, the greenfield nature of India’s digital health infrastructure presents an excellent opportunity to avoid the pitfalls of complex, restrictive, digital health systems that have evolved elsewhere. We propose here a federated, patient-centric, application programming interface (API)–enabled health information ecosystem that leverages India’s near-universal mobile phone penetration, universal availability of unique ID systems, and evolving privacy and data protection laws. It builds on global best practices and promotes the adoption of human-centered design principles, data minimization, and open standard APIs. The recommendations are the result of 18 months of deliberations with multiple stakeholders in India and the United States, including from academia, industry, and government."
A New System for Surveillance and Digital Contact Tracing for COVID-19: Spatiotemporal Reporting Over Network and GPS,"Shaoxiong Wang, Shuizi Ding, Li Xiong",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2020;8(6):e19457,"unstructured: The current pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has highlighted the importance of rapid control of the transmission of infectious diseases. This is particularly important for COVID-19, where many individuals are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms but can still spread the disease. Current systems for controlling transmission rely on patients to report their symptoms to medical professionals and be able to recall and trace all their contacts from the previous few days. This is unrealistic in the modern world. However, existing smartphone-based GPS and social media technology may provide a suitable alternative. We, therefore, developed a mini-program within the app WeChat. This analyzes data from all users and traces close contacts of all patients. This permits early tracing and quarantine of potential sources of infection. Data from the mini-program can also be merged with other data to predict epidemic trends, calculate individual and population risks, and provide recommendations for individual and population protection action. It may also improve our understanding of how the disease spreads. However, there are a number of unresolved questions about the use of smartphone data for health surveillance, including how to protect individual privacy and provide safeguards against data breaches."
"Constrains Faced by Tb Patients Leading to Non-Compliance: A Cross Sectional Study in Mardan, Kpk, Pakistan",Yousaf Ali Khan,iproc 2018;4(1):e10601,"Background: Pakistan is among the high endemic countries for TB and ranked 5th in the high TB burden countries with estimated 4th highest prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) TB. TB patients in Pakistan are facing different socio-economic and cultural constraints. TB patients are stigmatized and have been affected negatively due to poor knowledge about the disease dynamics, wrong socio-cultural myths and misapprehensions in general public.Objective: The study conducted by active TB patients to explore and evaluate different constraints that TB patients are facing in Mardan, Pakistan.Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in district Mardan during March to June 2015. From 350 selected patients 210 were enrolled in study after informed consents. Data were collected though structured questionnaire and statistically analyzed by Epi-info/SPSS.Results: Overcrowding (P=.001, CI, 95%), unawareness of disease (86%), low educational status (P<.002, CI 95%), poverty and access to healthcare facilities were directly related to poor compliance. Attitude of family members, colleagues, society and even healthcare staff (P=.002, CI 95%) were also found significant. Age groups, marital status and treatment duration were found to be highly significant (P<.002). 85% patients were unaware with the risk factors and precautions during the treatment. 42% patients were unemployed, 58% employed less than 200 USD/month (P=.001, CI 95%). 59% patients complained worst behavior of their colleagues (P=.001) and 41.7% complained worst behavior of healthcare staff (P=.003, CI 95%).Conclusions: TB patients were found stigmatized due to poor economic conditions and bad attitude of family, colleagues and healthcare staff. Unemployment, malnutrition and overcrowding were among the worst constraints. Sensitization of medical staff and doctors to diagnose the disease in time and behave properly with patients is recommended. Dedicated patients and family education sessions must be conducted."
eMental Healthcare Technologies for Anxiety and Depression in Childhood and Adolescence: Systematic Review of Studies Reporting Implementation Outcomes,"Lori Mae Wozney, Patrick J McGrath, Nicole D Gehring, Kathryn Bennett, Anna Huguet, Lisa Hartling, Michele P Dyson, Amir Soleimani, Amanda S Newton",JMIR Ment Health 2018;5(2):e48,"Background: Anxiety disorders and depression are frequent conditions in childhood and adolescence. eMental healthcare technologies may improve access to services, but their uptake within health systems is limited.Objective: The objective of this review was to examine and describe how the implementation of eMental healthcare technologies for anxiety disorders and depression in children and adolescents has been studied.Methods: We conducted a search of 5 electronic databases and gray literature. Eligible studies were those that assessed an eMental healthcare technology for treating or preventing anxiety or depression, included children or adolescents (<18 years), or their parents or healthcare providers and reported findings on technology implementation. The methodological quality of studies was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Outcomes of interest were based on 8 implementation outcomes: acceptability (satisfaction with a technology), adoption (technology uptake and utilization), appropriateness (“fitness for purpose”), cost (financial impact of technology implementation), feasibility (extent to which a technology was successfully used), fidelity (implementation as intended), penetration (“spread” or “reach” of the technology), and sustainability (maintenance or integration of a technology within a healthcare service). For extracted implementation outcome data, we coded favorable ratings on measurement scales as “positive results” and unfavorable ratings on measurement scales as “negative results.” Those studies that reported both positive and negative findings were coded as having “mixed results.”Results: A total of 46 studies met the inclusion criteria, the majority of which were rated as very good to excellent in methodological quality. These studies investigated eMental healthcare technologies for anxiety (n=23), depression (n=18), or both anxiety and depression (n=5). Studies of technologies for anxiety evaluated the following: (1) acceptability (78%) reported high levels of satisfaction, (2) adoption (43%) commonly reported positive results, and (3) feasibility (43%) reported mixed results. Studies of technologies for depression evaluated the following: (1) appropriateness (56%) reported moderate helpfulness and (2) acceptability (50%) described a mix of both positive and negative findings. Studies of technologies designed to aid anxiety and depression commonly reported mixed experiences with acceptability and adoption and positive findings for appropriateness of the technologies for treatment. Across all studies, cost, fidelity, and penetration and sustainability were the least measured implementation outcomes.Conclusions: Acceptability of eMental healthcare technology is high among users and is the most commonly investigated implementation outcome. Perceptions of the appropriateness and adoption of eMental healthcare technology were varied. Implementation research that identifies, evaluates, and reports on costs, sustainability, and fidelity to clinical guidelines is crucial for making high-quality eMental healthcare available to children and adolescents."
eHealth Engagement as a Response to Negative Healthcare Experiences: Cross-Sectional Survey Analysis,"Nicole Senft, Jordan Everson",J Med Internet Res 2018;20(12):e11034,"Background: eHealth provides individuals with new means of accessing health information and communicating with providers through online channels. Prior evidence suggests that patients use eHealth to find information online when they receive care that is low in patient centeredness. However, it is unclear how other problems with the healthcare-delivery system motivate the use of eHealth, how these problems relate to different kinds of eHealth activities, and which populations are most likely to use eHealth when they receive low-quality care.Objective: We aimed to determine how two types of negative care experiences—low patient centeredness and care coordination problems—motivate the use of different eHealth activities, and whether more highly educated individuals, who may find these tools easier to use, are more likely to use eHealth following negative experiences than less highly educated individuals.Methods: Using nationally representative data from the 2017 Health Information National Trends Survey, we used factor analysis to group 25 different eHealth activities into categories based on the correlation between respondents’ reports of their usage. Subsequently, we used multivariate negative binomial generalized linear model regressions to determine whether negative healthcare experiences predicted greater use of these resulting categories. Finally, we stratified our sample based on education level to determine whether the associations between healthcare experiences and eHealth use differed across groups.Results: The study included 2612 individuals. Factor analysis classified the eHealth activities into two categories: provider-facing (eg, facilitating communication with providers) and independent (eg, patient-driven information seeking and communication with non-providers). Negative care experiences were not associated with provider-facing eHealth activity in the overall population (care coordination: P=.16; patient centeredness: P=.57) or among more highly educated respondents (care coordination: P=.73; patient centeredness: P=.32), but respondents with lower education levels who experienced problems with care coordination used provider-facing eHealth more often (IRR=1.40, P=.07). Individuals engaged in more independent eHealth activities if they experienced problems with either care coordination (IRR=1.15 P=.01) or patient-centered communication (IRR=1.16, P=.01). Although care coordination problems predicted independent eHealth activity across education levels (higher education: IRR=1.13 P=.01; lower education: IRR=1.19, P=.07), the relationship between low perceived patient centeredness and independent activity was limited to individuals with lower education levels (IRR=1.25, P=.02).Conclusions: Individuals use a greater number of eHealth activities, especially activities that are independent of healthcare providers, when they experience problems with their healthcare. People with lower levels of education seem particularly inclined to use eHealth when they have negative healthcare experiences. To maximize the potential for eHealth to meet the needs of all patients, especially those who are traditionally underserved by the healthcare system, additional work should be performed to ensure that eHealth resources are accessible and usable to all members of the population."
Philips Lifeline CareSage Analytics Engine: Retrospective Evaluation on Patients of Partners Healthcare at Home,"Mariana Simons, Jorn op den Buijs, Linda Schertzer",iproc 2016;2(1):e8,"Background: The most common cause of emergency transports/admissions in the aging population is deterioration in their health status due to multiple chronic conditions. To meet the needs of this population, healthcare systems are seeking cost-effective ways to monitor, diagnose, and treat patients, based on connected solutions that seamlessly integrate data and provide actionable insights. The Philips Lifeline’s CareSage program for elderly and frail people utilizes a Personal Emergency Response Service (PERS) to detect medical emergencies and to promote independent living. The system tracks the types and outcomes of incidents, in particular the emergency transport-related events. Their timely detection is critical in optimizing clinical and financial outcomes.Objective: The study objectives are to evaluate (1) healthcare utilization and expenditure and (2) the CareSage predictive model on patients of Partners Healthcare at Home who have been using the Philips Lifeline service. This study is unique in utilizing PERS connected technology as a source of data to identify patients at risk of emergency transports or admissions that cause high healthcare expenditure.Methods: We identified 3335 patients with in-/out-patient encounters in 5 Partners Healthcare-affiliated hospitals through cross-reference of Philips Lifeline and Partners Healthcare at Home (PLL/PHH) data. The patients’ demographics, clinical outcomes, and healthcare expenditure for fiscal years 2011-2015 were extracted from Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) of Partners Healthcare. The medical alert data related to PERS utilization were extracted from the Philips Lifeline database. Retrospective statistical analysis of hospital utilization and healthcare cost was performed. Further, the CareSage logistic regression model that uses only PERS data to predict emergency room (ER) transport was validated on PHH patients. A new model predicting ER admissions was developed using boosted regression trees on a combination of PERS and electronic health record (EHR) data. Model performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and the positive predictive value (PPV).Results: Patients in the top (5%), middle (6-50%), and bottom (51-100%) segments of the cost acuity pyramid account for 40%, 55%, and 5% of the total healthcare expenditure, respectively, and these percentages stay stable across fiscal years 2011-2015. Increasing trends in total cost and average cost per patient and per encounter were detected through 2011-2015 based on linear regression analysis. The current CareSage predictive model that identifies patients at high risk of emergency transport in the coming 30 days has AUC=0.74 on the PHH population, whilst the new model that identifies patients at high risk of emergency admission in the coming 30 days has AUC=0.82. For prediction windows of one year, the PPV in the top 5% was also good: 63% and 67% for emergency transport and admission, respectively.Conclusions: Predictive models based on PERS and EHR data can identify patients at risk of emergency transports and admissions that account for high healthcare cost. Healthcare organizations can use the outcome of the predictive models to design relevant interventions targeting their high risk patients."
High Touch and High Tech (HT2) Proposal: Transforming Patient Engagement Throughout the Continuum of Care by Engaging Patients with Portal Technology at the Bedside,"Ann Scheck McAlearney, Cynthia J Sieck, Jennifer L Hefner, Alison M Aldrich, Daniel M Walker, Milisa K Rizer, Susan D Moffatt-Bruce, Timothy R Huerta",JMIR Res Protoc 2016;5(4):e221,"Background: For patients with complex care needs, engagement in disease management activities is critical. Chronic illnesses touch almost every person in the United States. The costs are real, personal, and pervasive. In response, patients often seek tools to help them manage their health. Patient portals, personal health records tethered to an electronic health record, show promise as tools that patients value and that can improve health. Although patient portals currently focus on the outpatient experience, the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) has deployed a portal designed specifically for the inpatient experience that is connected to the ambulatory patient portal available after discharge. While this inpatient technology is in active use at only one other hospital in the United States, health care facilities are currently investing in infrastructure necessary to support large-scale deployment. Times of acute crisis such as hospitalization may increase a patient’s focus on his/her health. During this time, patients may be more engaged with their care and especially interested in using tools to manage their health after discharge. Evidence shows that enhanced patient self-management can lead to better control of chronic illness. Patient portals may serve as a mechanism to facilitate increased engagement.Objective: The specific aims of our study are (1) to investigate the independent effects of providing both High Tech and High Touch interventions on patient-reported outcomes at discharge, including patients’ self-efficacy for managing chronic conditions and satisfaction with care; and (2) to conduct a mixed-methods analysis to determine how providing patients with access to MyChart Bedside (MCB, High Tech) and training/education on patient portals, and MyChart Ambulatory (MCA, High Touch) will influence engagement with the patient portal and relate to longer-term outcomes.Methods: Our proposed 4-year study uses a mixed-methods research (MMR) approach to evaluate a randomized controlled trial studying the effectiveness of a High Tech intervention (MCB, the inpatient portal), and an accompanying High Touch intervention (training patients to use the portal to manage their care and conditions) in a sample of hospitalized patients with two or more chronic conditions. This study measures how access to a patient portal tailored to the inpatient stay can improve patient experience and increase patient engagement by (1) improving patients’ perceptions of the process of care while in the hospital; (2) increasing patients’ self-efficacy for managing chronic conditions; and (3) facilitating continued use of a patient portal for care management after discharge. In addition, we aim to enhance patients’ use of the portal available to outpatients (MCA) once they are discharged.Results: This study has been funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Research is ongoing and expected to conclude in August 2019.Conclusions: Providing patients real-time access to health information can be a positive force for change in the way care is provided. Meaningful use policies require minimum demonstrated use of patient portal technology, most often in the ambulatory setting. However, as the technology matures to bridge the care transition, there is a greater need to understand how patient portals transform care delivery. By working in concert with patients to address and extend current technologies, our study aims to advance efforts to increase patients’ engagement in their care and develop a template for how other hospitals might integrate similar technologies."
Is Connected Health Contributing to a Healthier Population?,"Carmen G. Loiselle, Saima Ahmed",J Med Internet Res 2017;19(11):e386,"unstructured: Connected health tools, including mobile phones, incorporate various functions that capture events, direct actions, and make informed decisions based on complex sources of data. Connected health, a term recently proposed by some academics and industry, refers to the development, testing, and integration of smart technology tools into health care. Through these means, connected health creates interconnectivity across various environments, profoundly changing the way we learn, self-regulate, and communicate with one another. In health care, mobile phones enable more precise diagnostics, personalized health recommendations that enhance patient experiences and outcomes while containing health care costs. However, for connected health to achieve its full potential, issues must be addressed pertaining to active engagement in use, privacy, security, and quality, as well as the development of evidence-based guidelines. This commentary discusses these key challenges and explores the promise of connected health, specifically eHealth and mHealth. Anchored within the context of cancer, the authors’ area of expertise, the ideas put forward can readily be applied to other health-related disciplines."
"Epidemiology and Predictors of Survival of MERS-CoV Infections in Riyadh Region, 2016","Fahad Al-Jasser, R Nooh, R Youssef",iproc 2018;4(1):e10602,"Background: MERS-CoV emerged as a zoonotic disease in Saudi Arabia with 1437 cases as of July 2016.Objective: This study aimed at describing the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection, clinical aspects of the disease and the determinants of survival.Methods: Medical records were reviewed between April 2014 and December 2015 to identify admission and discharge with MERS-CoV. Patients’ characteristics, epidemiologic and clinical data and laboratory results were extracted and described. Logistic regression analyses were used to model the determinants of the survival of these patients. Significance of the results were judged at the 5% level.Results: 249 laboratory confirmed cases were admitted mostly in August (20.48%) and September (14.86%) of the year 2015. These cases were non-healthcare workers (85.14%), Saudi (58.63%), males (57.03%) with a mean age of 46.71±17.92 years. A third (39.36%) reported contact with suspected or confirmed cases, developed the disease after 6.2 days and continued to shed the virus for 13.17 days on average. The case fatality rate was 20.08%. The likelihood of being discharged alive was significantly higher among non-Saudi (OR=2.35), healthcare workers (OR=10.822), with no co-morbidities (OR=6.57).Conclusions: MERS-CoV mortality is higher among older patients with severe disease. Further studies are recommended for a better estimation of the incubation period and the period of communicability and the role of animal reservoir."
Early User Centered Insights on Voice Integrated Technologies Through Retrospective Analysis,"Marty Coyne, Colby Thomas, Ashley Collimore, Chris Franzese, Charles Hwang",iproc 2017;3(1):e49,"Background: There is increasing interest in incorporating voice-activated technology (VAT), such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Microsoft Cortana, into the existing connected health, mHealth, and mobile medical app ecosystems. VATs allow for natural-language interactions and offer patients the promise of increased usability, greater engagement, and improved adherence to treatments and/or medications. Despite this interest, there is little ethnographic data on patients’ use of VAT or unmet needs. This data is critical to developing VAT applications that interact with medical devices, where regulatory or design control considerations require a higher level of rigor compared to unregulated consumer applications. As first-mover, Amazon Alexa technology has dominated the VAT market; customer reviews of Alexa-enabled devices outnumber the next closest technology 19 to 1. We hypothesized that Amazon Alexa was a good proxy for VAT users at large, and that systematic coding and analysis of 95,000 reviews for Amazon Alexa devices could provide insights that would accelerate follow-on research efforts to support development of user-centered VAT applications for connected health.Objective: Primarily, we sought to explore whether Amazon reviews could be used to develop initial research hypotheses, pain points, and user insights, in much the same way complaint reviews inform early development of medical devices and interventions. Secondarily, we explored whether VAT reviews could be used to identify unmet needs around VAT-for-healthcare applications.Methods: We conducted an exploratory, manual retrospective analysis of 28,271 full-text user reviews for Amazon’s Echo and Dot devices, including all reviews from February to July 2017. This represented approximately 31% of all available Amazon Alexa review data. Two authors (CT/AC) screened each review for relevance, defined as any mention of an issue related to use, misuse, unintended/unexpected event, or novel application of technology. Relevant reviews were manually coded by the authors into one or more of nine categories.Results: There were 284/28,271 user reviews (~1%) that were relevant, yielding valuable user-related insights in our areas of interest. Most relevant reviews focused on Healthcare-Related Workarounds (141), Quality of Life Improvement (159), and Physical Disability (93). We also found relevant, useful information related to Neurological Disorder/Disability (39), Unauthorized Interactions (23), Unexpected Use Settings (33), Natural Language Barriers/Advantages (50), Companionship (50), and Noteworthy Benefits to Healthcare (16). We found the reviews to contain significant detail, allowing us to generate initial insights without the expenditure and complexity of traditional user research.Conclusions: The results of our manual review and coding provided unexpectedly rich information regarding unique device uses, curious workarounds, and unexpected complications. This analysis offers an early effort to improve understanding of how this type of technology may be used in the medical field. Given the currently sparse literature in this space, our study provides a roadmap for future studies centered around VATs in digital health. All remaining reviews should be similarly analyzed and catalogued for future use. Such investigations could involve more detailed exploration of patient practices using other user research methods in order to inform future development in this area."
My Hypertension Education and Reaching Target (MyHEART): Development and Dissemination of a Patient-Centered Website for Young Adults with Hypertension,"Heather M M Johnson, Jamie N LaMantia, Colleen M Brown, Ryan C Warner, Laura M Zeller, Ryan C Haggart, Keven Stonewall, Diane R Lauver",JMIR Cardio 2017;1(2):e5,"Background: Young adults (18 to 39 years old) with hypertension have the lowest rates of blood pressure control (defined as blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg) compared to other adult age groups. Approximately 1 in 15 young adults have high blood pressure, increasing their risk of future heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, and/or chronic kidney disease. Many young adults reported having few resources to address their needs for health education on managing cardiovascular risk.Objective: The goal of our study was to develop and disseminate a website with evidence-based, clinical information and health behavior resources tailored to young adults with hypertension.Methods: In collaboration with young adults, health systems, and community stakeholders, the My Hypertension Education and Reaching Target (MyHEART) website was created. A toolkit was also developed for clinicians and healthcare systems to disseminate the website within their organizations. The dissemination plan was guided by the Dissemination Planning Tool of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).Results: Google Analytics data were acquired for January 1, 2017 to June 29, 2017. The MyHEART website received 1090 visits with 2130 page views; 18.99% (207/1090) were returning visitors. The majority (55.96%, 610/1090) approached the website through organic searches, 34.95% (381/1090) accessed the MyHEART website directly, and 5.96% (65/1090) approached through referrals from other sites. There was a spike in site visits around times of increased efforts to disseminate the website.Conclusions: The successfully implemented MyHEART website and toolkit reflect collaborative input from community and healthcare stakeholders to provide evidence-based, portable hypertension education to a hard-to-reach population. The MyHEART website and toolkit can support healthcare providers’ education and counseling with young adults and organizations’ hypertension population health goals."

Integrated Models of Care for People Living with Hepatitis C Virus and a Substance Use Disorder: Protocol for a Systematic Review,"Lianping Ti, Stephanie Parent, María Eugenia Socías",JMIR Res Protoc 2018;7(5):e122,"Background: People living with a substance use disorder (SUD) are a key population within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic. While integrated and community-based models of care have shown positive outcomes among this population, the literature has been primarily focused on the HIV context. This paper outlines a systematic review protocol on the impact of various integrated models of care, which includes HCV and SUD services, on various treatment, and health-related outcomes among this population.Objective: The objective of this review is to determine the impact of integrated models of care on HCV and addiction treatment and health-related outcomes for adults living with HCV and an SUD.Methods: We will search 5 databases, article reference lists, and abstracts from relevant conferences that investigate the impact of integrated models of care on treatment and health-related outcomes among people living with HCV and an SUD. Database searches will be conducted and titles, abstracts, and the full-text of the relevant studies will be independently reviewed in separate stages. The methodological quality of included studies will be assessed using a validated tool. Data from included articles will be extracted using a standardized form and synthesized in a narrative account.Results: For this project, we have received funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research. To date, we have completed the search strategy, reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full-texts. Grading the selected studies and qualitative synthesis of the results are currently under way, and we expect the final results to be submitted for publication in the fall of 2018.Conclusions: The systematic review will describe different integrated models of care that could be effective in improving the health and well-being of people living with HCV and an SUD.

Healthcare Cost Analysis of Older Patients Using a Personal Emergency Response Service Uncovers Costs Savings Opportunity,"Mariana Simons, Sara Golas, Stephen Agboola, Jorn op den Buijs, Nils Fischer, Jennifer Felsted, Linda Schertzer",iproc 2017;3(1):e26,"Background: In the US healthcare system, half of overall Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement goes towards caring for the top 5% most expensive patients. However, little is known about how these patients' costs change annually prior to them reaching the top 5%. To address these gaps and investigate potential cost savings opportunities, we analyzed patient flow and associated healthcare cost trends over the period 2011-2015.Objective: To evaluate longitudinal trends in healthcare cost of older patients using Personal Emergency Response Service (PERS).Methods: This is a retrospective, longitudinal, multicenter study to evaluate healthcare cost of 2,643 older patients over the period 2011-2015. All patients had at least one inpatient and/or outpatient encounter, and at least one episode of home health care during the study period. In addition, all patients used PERS at home anytime during the study period. The study population was segmented by their annual healthcare expenditures into Top (5%), Middle (6-50%) and Bottom (51-100%) segments. Cost acuity pyramids were built based on these segments for each fiscal year. The longitudinal healthcare expenditure trends of the complete study population, as well as each segment, were assessed by linear regression models. Patient flows throughout the segments of the cost acuity pyramids from year to year were modeled by Markov chains. The associated costs flows were quantified over a 2-year period.Results: Total healthcare cost of the study population nearly doubled from $17.7M in 2011 to $33.0M in 2015. This increasing trend was statistically significant (P=0.003) with an expected yearly cost increase of $3.6M. This growth was driven by a significantly higher cost increase in the Middle segment ($2.3M; P=0.002). The expected yearly costs increase of the Top and Bottom segments was $1.2M (P=0.008) and $0.1M (P=0.003) respectively, and both were statistically significant. The patients and cost flow analyses showed that 18% of patients moved up the cost acuity pyramid yearly, and their cost increased by 672% in contrast to 22% of patients who moved down with a cost decrease by 86%. The remaining 60% of patients stayed in the same segment from year to year, but their cost increased by 18%.Conclusions: While many healthcare organizations target costly intensive interventions for their most expensive patients, this analysis unveiled a potential cost savings opportunity by managing the patients in the lower cost segments that are at risk of moving up the cost acuity pyramid. To achieve this, data analytics that integrate longitudinal data from the EHR and home monitoring devices may help healthcare organizations to optimize resources by enabling clinicians to proactively manage patients in their home or community environments, beyond institutional settings and 30-60 day telehealth services."
Using Social Media to Generate and Collect Primary Data: The #ShowsWorkplaceCompassion Twitter Research Campaign,"Wendy Clyne, Sally Pezaro, Karen Deeny, Rosie Kneafsey",JMIR Public Health Surveill 2018;4(2):e41,"Background: Compassion is a core value embedded in the concept of quality in healthcare. The need for compassion toward healthcare staff in the workplace, for their own health and well-being and also to enable staff to deliver compassionate care for patients, is increasingly understood. However, we do not currently know how healthcare staff understand and characterize compassion toward themselves as opposed to patients.Objective: The aim of this study was to use social media for the generation and collection of primary data to gain understanding of the concept of workplace compassion.Methods: Tweets that contained the hashtag #ShowsWorkplaceCompassion were collected from Twitter and analyzed. The study took place between April 21 and May 21, 2016. Participants were self-selecting users of the social media service Twitter. The study was promoted by a number of routes: the National Health Service (NHS) England website, the personal Twitter accounts of the research team, internal NHS England communications, and via social media sharing. Participants were asked to contribute their views about what activities, actions, policies, philosophies or approaches demonstrate workplace compassion in healthcare using the hashtag #ShowsWorkplaceCompassion. All tweets including the research hashtag #ShowsWorkplaceCompassion were extracted from Twitter and studied using content analysis. Data concerning the frequency, nature, origin, and location of Web-based engagement with the research campaign were collected using Bitly (Bitly, Inc, USA) and Symplur (Symplur LLC, USA) software.Results: A total of 260 tweets were analyzed. Of the 251 statements within the tweets that were coded, 37.8% (95/251) of the statements concerned Leadership and Management aspects of workplace compassion, 29.5% (74/251) were grouped under the theme related to Values and Culture, 17.5% (44/251) of the statements related to Personalized Policies and Procedures that support workplace compassion, and 15.2% (38/251) of the statements concerned Activities and Actions that show workplace compassion. Content analysis showed that small acts of kindness, an embedded organizational culture of caring for one another, and recognition of the emotional and physical impact of healthcare work were the most frequently mentioned characteristics of workplace compassion in healthcare.Conclusions: This study presents a new and innovative research approach using Twitter. Although previous research has analyzed the nature and pattern of tweets retrospectively, this study used Twitter to both recruit participants and collect primary data."
"Assessment of Immunization Session Practices in Primary Healthcare Centers - Wasit Province, Iraq, 2016-17","Ali Amily, F Lami",iproc 2018;4(1):e10622,"Background: Annually, vaccines prevent more than 2.5 million child deaths globally. WHO and UNICEF estimates of immunization coverage in Iraq in 2016 revealed 63% for DTP3 and 66% for MCV1. Wasit is among governorates with a large number of under-immunized children, opening the door for many future outbreaks. Immunization session practices (ISPs), when maintained of high-quality, can ensure safer and more effective vaccination as well as higher coverage rates.Objective: The objective of this study was to assess ISPs in Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) in Wasit province.Methods: We conducted this cross-sectional study on 24(44%) PHCs in Wasit province, selected by simple random sampling. Based on WHO and the national guidelines, checklists were developed to assess 58 ISPs that were grouped into seven domains: vaccine and diluent management, cold chain management, session’s equipment, communication with clients and caregivers, vaccine preparation and administration, card review and registration and waste management. The score (out of 100%) was calculated for each domain in all selected PHCs, then the average for all domains was calculated in each PHC. The assessment was made by direct on-job observation of immunization sessions, through a single visit conducted to each PHC.Results: PHCs were ranging in their ISPs: 52-78%; with a mean of 67% (±8%). The highest scores were for the following domains: session’s equipment (88%), waste management (82%) and card review and registration (81%). The least achieving domains were: communication with clients and caregivers (36%) and cold chain management (38%). Vaccine preparation and administration was scoring 69%, whereas the score for vaccine and diluent management was only 50%.Conclusions: ISPs practiced in PHCs in Wasit province were far from the standard. National Expanded Program on Immunization should work on raising the capacity of vaccinators, particularly their communication skills with the clients and caregivers and the management of vaccines and cold chain."
My Team of Care Study: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of a Web-Based Communication Tool for Collaborative Care in Patients With Advanced Cancer,"Teja Voruganti, Eva Grunfeld, Trevor Jamieson, Allison M Kurahashi, Bhadra Lokuge, Monika K Krzyzanowska, Muhammad Mamdani, Rahim Moineddin, Amna Husain",J Med Internet Res 2017;19(7):e219,"Background: The management of patients with complex care needs requires the expertise of health care providers from multiple settings and specialties. As such, there is a need for cross-setting, cross-disciplinary solutions that address deficits in communication and continuity of care. We have developed a Web-based tool for clinical collaboration, called Loop, which assembles the patient and care team in a virtual space for the purpose of facilitating communication around care management.Objective: The objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate the feasibility of integrating a tool like Loop into current care practices and to capture preliminary measures of the effect of Loop on continuity of care, quality of care, symptom distress, and health care utilization.Methods: We conducted an open-label pilot cluster randomized controlled trial allocating patients with advanced cancer (defined as stage III or IV disease) with ≥3 months prognosis, their participating health care team and caregivers to receive either the Loop intervention or usual care. Outcome data were collected from patients on a monthly basis for 3 months. Trial feasibility was measured with rate of uptake, as well as recruitment and system usage. The Picker Continuity of Care subscale, Palliative care Outcomes Scale, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and Ambulatory and Home Care Record were patient self-reported measures of continuity of care, quality of care, symptom distress, and health services utilization, respectively. We conducted a content analysis of messages posted on Loop to understand how the system was used.Results: Nineteen physicians (oncologists or palliative care physicians) were randomized to the intervention or control arms. One hundred twenty-seven of their patients with advanced cancer were approached and 48 patients enrolled. Of 24 patients in the intervention arm, 20 (83.3%) registered onto Loop. In the intervention and control arms, 12 and 11 patients completed three months of follow-up, respectively. A mean of 1.2 (range: 0 to 4) additional healthcare providers with an average total of 3 healthcare providers participated per team. An unadjusted between-arm increase of +11.4 was observed on the Picker scale in favor of the intervention arm. Other measures showed negligible changes. Loop was primarily used for medical care management, symptom reporting, and appointment coordination.Conclusions: The results of this study show that implementation of Loop was feasible. It provides useful information for planning future studies further examining effectiveness and team collaboration.

A Smartphone Attention Bias Intervention for Individuals With Addictive Disorders: Protocol for a Feasibility Study,"Melvyn Wb Zhang, Jiangbo Ying, Syidda B Amron, Zaakira Mahreen, Guo Song, Daniel SS Fung, Helen Smith",JMIR Res Protoc 2018;7(11):e11822,"Background: Substance use disorders are highly prevalent globally. Relapse rates following conventional psychological interventions for substance use disorders remain high. Recent reviews have highlighted attentional and approach or avoidance biases to be responsible for multiple relapses. Other studies have reported the efficacy of interventions to modify biases. With advances in technologies, there are now mobile versions of conventional bias modification interventions. However, to date, no study has evaluated bias modification in a substance-using, non-Western sample. Existing evaluations of mobile technologies for the delivery of bias interventions are also limited to alcohol or tobacco use disorders.Objective: This study aims to examine the feasibility of mobile-based attention bias modification intervention among treatment-seeking individuals with substance use and alcohol use disorders.Methods: This is a feasibility study, in which inpatients who are in their rehabilitation phase of clinical management will be recruited. On each day that they are in the study, they will be required to complete a craving visual analogue scale and undertake both a visual probe-based assessment and and modification task in a smartphone app . Reaction time data will be collated for the computation of baseline attentional biases and to determine whether there is a reduction of attentional bias across the interventions. Feasibility will be determined by the number of participants recruited and participants’ adherence to the planned interventions up until the completion of their rehabilitation program and by the ability of the app in detecting baseline biases and changes in biases. Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by a short questionnaire of users’ perceptions of the intervention. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 22.0, while qualitative analysis of the perspectives will be performed using NVivo version 10.0.Results: This study was approved by the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Research Board, with approval number (2018/00316). Results will be disseminated by means of conferences and publications.Currently, we are in the process of recruitment for this study.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile attention bias modification intervention for individuals with substance use disorders. The data pertaining to the feasibility and acceptability are undoubtedly crucial because they imply the potential use of mobile technologies in retraining attentional biases among inpatients admitted for medical-assisted detoxification and rehabilitation. Participants’ feedback pertaining to the ease of use, interactivity, and motivation to continue using the app is crucial because it will determine whether a codesign approach might be warranted to design an app that is acceptable for participants and that participants themselves would be motivated to use.registered-report: PRR1-10.2196/11822"
Use of Apps to Promote Childhood Vaccination: Protocol for a Systematic Review,"Michelle Helena Van Velthoven, Madison Milne-Ives, Caroline de Cock, Mary Mooney, Edward Meinert",JMIR Res Protoc 2020;9(2):e16929,"Background: The decline in the uptake of routine childhood vaccinations has resulted in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination apps can be used as a tool to promote immunization through the provision of reminders, dissemination of information, peer support, and feedback.Objective: The aim of this review is to systematically review the evidence on the use of apps to support childhood vaccination uptake, information storage, and record sharing.Methods: We will identify relevant papers by searching the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase by Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). We will review the reference lists of those studies that we include to identify relevant additional papers not initially identified using our search strategy. In addition to the use of electronic databases, we will search for grey literature on the topic. The search strategy will include only terms relating to or describing the intervention, which is app use. As almost all titles and abstracts are in English, 100% of these will be reviewed, but retrieval will be confined to papers written in the English language. We will record the search outcome on a specifically designed record sheet. Two reviewers will select observational and intervention studies, appraise the quality of the studies, and extract the relevant data. All studies will involve the use of apps relating to child vaccinations. The primary outcome is the uptake of vaccinations. Secondary outcomes are as follows: (1) use of app for sharing of information and providing vaccination reminders and (2) use of app for storage of vaccination information; knowledge and decision making by parents regarding vaccination (ie, risks and benefits of vaccination); costs and cost-effectiveness of vaccination apps; use of the app and measures of usability (eg, usefulness, acceptability, and experiences of different users: parents and  health care professionals); use of technical standards for development of the app; and adverse events (eg, data leaks and misinformation). We will exclude studies that do not study an app. We anticipate a limited scope for meta-analysis and will provide a narrative overview of findings and tabular summaries of extracted data.Results: This project was funded by the Sir David Cooksey Fellowship in Healthcare Translation at the University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. We will submit the full systematic review for publication in the Journal of Medical Internet Research.Conclusions: This review will follow, where possible, the Cochrane Collaboration and the Centre for Review and Dissemination methodologies for conducting systematic reviews. We will report our findings based on guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The review results will be used to inform the development of a vaccination app.registered-report: PRR1-10.2196/16929"
Understanding and Addressing Variation in Health Care–Associated Infections After Durable Ventricular Assist Device Therapy: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study,"P Paul Chandanabhumma, Michael D Fetters, Francis D Pagani, Preeti N Malani, John M Hollingsworth, Russell J Funk, Keith D Aaronson, Min Zhang, Robert L Kormos, Carol E Chenoweth, Supriya Shore, Tessa M F Watt, Lourdes Cabrera, Donald S Likosky",JMIR Res Protoc 2020;9(1):e14701,"Background: Durable ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy is reserved for patients with advanced heart failure who have a poor estimated 1-year survival. However, despite highly protocolized management processes, patients are at a unique risk for developing a health care–associated infection (HAI). Few studies have examined optimal strategies for HAI prevention after durable VAD implantation, despite variability in rates across centers and their impact on short- and long-term outcomes.Objective: The objective of this study is to develop recommendations for preventing the most significant HAIs after durable VAD implantation. The study has 3 specific aims: (1) identify determinants of center-level variability in HAI rates, (2) develop comprehensive understanding of barriers and facilitators for achieving low center-level HAI rates, and (3) develop and disseminate a best practices toolkit for preventing HAIs that accommodates various center contexts.Methods: This is a sequential mixed methods study starting with a cross-sectional assessment of current practices. To address aim 1, we will conduct (1) a systematic review of HAI prevention studies and (2) in-depth quantitative analyses using administrative claims, in-depth clinical data, and organizational surveys of VAD centers. For aim 2, we will apply a mixed methods patient tracer assessment framework to conduct semistructured interviews, field observations, and document analysis informed by findings from aim 1 at 5 high-performing (ie, low HAIs) and 5 low-performing (ie, high HAI) centers, which will be examined using a mixed methods case series analysis. For aim 3, we will build upon the findings from the previous aims to develop and field test an HAI preventive toolkit, acquire stakeholder input at an annual cardiac surgical conference, disseminate the final version to VAD centers nationwide, and conduct follow-up surveys to assess the toolkit’s adoption.Results: The project was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2018 and enrollment for the overall project is ongoing. Data analysis is currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2019.Conclusions: This mixed methods study seeks to quantitatively assess the determinants of HAIs across clinical centers and qualitatively identify the context-specific facilitators and barriers for attaining low HAI rates. The mixed data findings will be used to develop and disseminate a stakeholder-acceptable toolkit of evidence-based HAI prevention recommendations that will accommodate the specific contexts and needs of VAD centers.registered-report: PRR1-10.2196/14701"
Developing a Model to Predict Hospital Encounters for Asthma in Asthmatic Patients: Secondary Analysis,"Gang Luo, Shan He, Bryan L Stone, Flory L Nkoy, Michael D Johnson",JMIR Med Inform 2020;8(1):e16080,"Background: As a major chronic disease, asthma causes many emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations each year. Predictive modeling is a key technology to prospectively identify high-risk asthmatic patients and enroll them in care management for preventive care to reduce future hospital encounters, including inpatient stays and ED visits. However, existing models for predicting hospital encounters in asthmatic patients are inaccurate. Usually, they miss over half of the patients who will incur future hospital encounters and incorrectly classify many others who will not. This makes it difficult to match the limited resources of care management to the patients who will incur future hospital encounters, increasing health care costs and degrading patient outcomes.Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a more accurate model for predicting hospital encounters in asthmatic patients.Methods: Secondary analysis of 334,564 data instances from Intermountain Healthcare from 2005 to 2018 was conducted to build a machine learning classification model to predict the hospital encounters for asthma in the following year in asthmatic patients. The patient cohort included all asthmatic patients who resided in Utah or Idaho and visited Intermountain Healthcare facilities during 2005 to 2018. A total of 235 candidate features were considered for model building.Results: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.859 (95% CI 0.846-0.871). When the cutoff threshold for conducting binary classification was set at the top 10.00% (1926/19,256) of asthmatic patients with the highest predicted risk, the model reached an accuracy of 90.31% (17,391/19,256; 95% CI 89.86-90.70), a sensitivity of 53.7% (436/812; 95% CI 50.12-57.18), and a specificity of 91.93% (16,955/18,444; 95% CI 91.54-92.31). To steer future research on this topic, we pinpointed several potential improvements to our model.Conclusions: Our model improves the state of the art for predicting hospital encounters for asthma in asthmatic patients. After further refinement, the model could be integrated into a decision support tool to guide asthma care management allocation.registered-report: RR2-10.2196/resprot.5039"
"Assessment of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) within Healthcare Facilities in Selected Eastern Mediterranean Countries","Adel Al-Rawahneh, M Rawahnih, Y Khader",iproc 2018;4(1):e10543,"Background: Inadequate drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in health care facilities impacts the health, particularly in low and middle-income countries. There is limited knowledge on the status of WASH in such settings.Objective: The primary objective of this study was to assess WASH conditions in health care facilities in four EM countries; Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon, and Pakistan.Methods: This study was based on secondary data analysis of the regional study on WASH services in health facilities. Separate samples of health care facilities were selected from Jordan (19 hospitals), Morocco (8 hospitals), Lebanon (14 hospitals), and Pakistan (8 hospitals) and were assessed using the WHO/CEHA tool WSH in the health facilities assessment tool. The assessment tool consisted of items to assess the WSH services availability, adequacy, and functionality.Results: All health care facilities (100%) in Jordan and Morocco, 71.4% of hospitals in Lebanon and none of the hospitals in Pakistan had a safe water source. Overall, all hospitals in Jordan, Morocco, and Lebanon and 71.4 % of hospitals in Pakistan had improved and gender separated toilets in inpatients settings (One per 20 users). About 84.2% of hospitals in Jordan, none in Morocco, 28.6% in Lebanon, and all hospitals in Pakistan had sufficient improved and gender separated toilets in outpatients setting. Overall, 84.2% of hospitals had sufficient and functioning handwashing basins with soap and water and 79.0% of hospitals had sufficient showers. The majority of hospitals in the selected countries have a policy for the safe management of healthcare waste but inadequate training program on healthcare waste.Conclusions: WASH services are not well implemented in health care facilities of the selected countries. The countries have to develop and implement a monitoring system for WASH services or at least support inclusion of WASH services in routine monitoring of health care services."
"Evaluating the Effects of a Rent Subsidy and Mentoring Intervention for Youth Transitioning Out of Homelessness: Protocol for a Mixed Methods, Community-Based Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Naomi S Thulien, Nicole Kozloff, Elizabeth McCay, Rosane Nisenbaum, Andrea Wang, Stephen W Hwang",JMIR Res Protoc 2019;8(12):e15557,"Background: Although the risk factors associated with young people entering and becoming entrenched in street life have been thoroughly investigated, peer-reviewed evidence is scarce to nonexistent for rigorous interventions targeting social integration outcomes for young people who have experienced homelessness. From the limited research that has been done, emerging evidence signals that, although structural supports such as subsidized housing and social service providers are important, these resources alone are insufficient to help young people integrate into the mainstream society.Objective: The overarching aim of this study is to assess whether and how rent subsidies and mentorship influence social integration outcomes for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing in 3 Canadian cities. The primary outcome measures for this study are community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem at 18 months. Secondary outcomes include social connectedness, hope, and academic and vocational participation at 18 months. Exploratory outcomes include income, perceived housing quality, engulfment, psychiatric symptoms, and participant perspectives of intervention barriers and facilitators.Methods: This is a convergent mixed methods, open-label, 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) framework. The intervention will provide 24 young people (aged 16-26 years), who have transitioned out of homelessness and into market rent housing within the past year, with rent subsidies for 24 months. Half of the young people will also be randomly assigned an adult mentor who has been recruited and screened by 1 of our 3 community partners. Data collection will occur every 6 months, and participants will be followed for 30 months.Results: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Providence, St Joseph’s, and St Michael’s Healthcare Research Ethics Board (number 18-251). Enrollment took place from April 2019 to September 2019. Preliminary analysis of the baseline quantitative and qualitative data is underway.Conclusions: This pilot RCT will be the first to test the impact of economic and social support on meaningful social integration for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing. We believe that the mixed methods design will illuminate important contextual factors that must be considered if the intervention is to be scaled up and replicated elsewhere. Importantly, the CBPAR framework will incorporate the perspectives of the community, including formerly homeless young people, who are in the best position to determine what might work best in the context of their lives.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03779204; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03779204."
"Versatile, Immersive, Creative and Dynamic Virtual 3-D Healthcare Learning Environments: A Review of the Literature",Margaret Mary Hansen,J Med Internet Res 2008;10(3):e26,Abstract is not available
Enhancing Video Chat Applications for Home Health Care,Steve Stutman,iproc 2016;2(1):e22,"Background: Estimates show that up to 87% of seniors would like to “age in place.” Often, such people are remote from their families and health care providers. Acquisition and telemetry of data and bio-signals from personal health care instrumentation is of great value, but we feel that this does not tell the complete story, because we are dealing with humans. A brief video chat, via personal computer, can usually provide a great deal of information concerning a person’s well-being. An individual’s mood, physical status, and energy level and the state of their surroundings can frequently be determined in a one-minute video chat. While these evaluations are qualitative, they can be very useful in answering the simple, important question “Is this person OK?” A video chat can also help build constructive social bonds between patients and providers because the telecommunication is no longer “faceless.” People who are aging in place are generally not the best computer users. Even if a person is proficient with the use of computers, issues with vision and manual dexterity can present obstacles to the use of video chat applications such as Skype. We have designed and implemented a low-cost system, comprised of a small “helper” program and a wired keypad, which operates with a personal computer and obviates the difficulties experienced by many less experienced and older users. Very simply, this system makes it easier for many people to communicate with their families and healthcare providers.Objective: Our goal was to simplify the use of video chat applications. A conventional desktop is often visually cluttered or has one application window obscuring another. Navigation with a mouse or other pointing device can be difficult for people with impaired vision and those with tremors, arthritis, or other dexterity limiting factors. We designed and built a “helper” program that, in conjunction with a dedicated large symbol keypad, lets a user initiate a video chat just by pressing a couple of buttons.Methods: At present we have conducted a small pilot study (N=8) with naïve computer users who want to video chat with family members. Participants in the study were chosen because they had difficulty initiating video chats. We asked this group to use our system and measured time required to initiate a video chat.Results: All subjects were able to initiate video chats in <30 seconds. The users were all able to terminate the chats when desired. In simple terms, the naïve users were able to start and end calls when they wanted to. Users expressed satisfaction at being able to control this aspect of their computers without technical support from others and enjoyed chat interactions.Conclusions: Video chat applications can be made simpler and easier to use, empowering a person who is aging in place to engage with family and healthcare providers."
Connecting Healthcare Providers With Patients Through Mobile Technology: Formula for Shared Decision Making and Improved Patient Outcomes,"Elaine Rudell, Patty Peterson, Sandeep Pulim, Andrea L Griffin, James D Bowen",iproc 2016;2(1):e3,"Background: Integration of mobile devices/health-related apps into medical practice is transforming healthcare. A 2015 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) technology survey of 238 respondents revealed ∼90% of healthcare providers utilize mobile devices to engage patients in their healthcare. A new app for clinicians, Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care powered by IBM Watson, paired with the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) patient app, My MS Manager, is a practice-based tool designed to provide shared decision making between the clinician and patient, syncing patient data via a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant mobile cloud platform. The Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care IBM Watson cognitive learning tool answers questions clinicians pose at point of care to improve patient outcomes.Objective: This analysis evaluates how clinicians use Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care, utilize our trained IBM Watson corpus, and benefit from the app. Additionally, the analysis assesses how patients use and benefit from the patient app and how both apps are used for shared decision making to improve patient care.Methods: To assess how clinicians utilize/value the Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care and patient app as well as how patients connect with their clinicians utilizing the patient app, data collected from participating clinicians (∼11,000+) caring for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and their participating patients were analyzed. The My MS Manager patient app provides a tool for patients to record their daily data regarding MS management and share this data with their clinician. Additionally, the clinician can access evidence-based answers at the time it is needed from the Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care clinician app. Together, these facilitate shared decision-making at the point of care. Data included demographic information, clinician and patient monthly access frequency, clinicians’ questions posed to Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care’s Ask Watson cognitive tool, clinicians’ self-reported impact of content on their patients’ health outcomes, number of registered patient app users, average active patient users/month, patient access frequency, patient record entries (including fatigue scale records), and patient perceived benefits.Results: Overall findings include that (1) clinicians and their patients use the Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care clinician app and MSAA patient app, respectively, enabling clinicians to sync with their patients’ data to improve outcomes; (2) many clinicians agree the clinician app, Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care, and the synched patient data from the My MS Manager app provide timely, relevant information that positively impacts their patients’ health outcomes; (3) increasing numbers of patients are using the patient app to enter their data, track their MS management, and share this data with their clinicians; and (4) the fatigue scale entries continue to increase and represent valuable information for their treating clinicians. Frequency of use reported by patients responding to this question show 77% access the patient app daily or weekly. Better fatigue management resulting from the use of the patient app was reported by 75% of patients responding to the survey.Conclusions: Clinicians engaged in learning utilizing Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care currently number 10,627 unique users who spend an average of 8 minutes per visit. Around 86% of My MS Manager patient app users revealed the app has motivated them to discuss their MS management with their clinician. Management of MS is evolving rapidly and the findings of this analysis show Multiple Sclerosis @Point of Care and the My MS Manager patient app facilitate the interface of clinicians and MS patients for shared decision making that support strategies for practice change and improved patient outcomes through point of care accessibility."
"Solution to Detect, Classify, and Report Illicit Online Marketing and Sales of Controlled Substances via Twitter: Using Machine Learning and Web Forensics to Combat Digital Opioid Access","Tim Ken Mackey, Janani Kalyanam, Josh Klugman, Ella Kuzmenko, Rashmi Gupta",J Med Internet Res 2018;20(4):e10029,"Background: On December 6 and 7, 2017, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) hosted its first Code-a-Thon event aimed at leveraging technology and data-driven solutions to help combat the opioid epidemic. The authors—an interdisciplinary team from academia, the private sector, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—participated in the Code-a-Thon as part of the prevention track.Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and deploy a methodology using machine learning to accurately detect the marketing and sale of opioids by illicit online sellers via Twitter as part of participation at the HHS Opioid Code-a-Thon event.Methods: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public application programming interface stream filtered for common prescription opioid keywords in conjunction with participation in the Code-a-Thon from November 15, 2017 to December 5, 2017. An unsupervised machine learning–based approach was developed and used during the Code-a-Thon competition (24 hours) to obtain a summary of the content of the tweets to isolate those clusters associated with illegal online marketing and sale using a biterm topic model (BTM). After isolating relevant tweets, hyperlinks associated with these tweets were reviewed to assess the characteristics of illegal online sellers.Results: We collected and analyzed 213,041 tweets over the course of the Code-a-Thon containing keywords codeine, percocet, vicodin, oxycontin, oxycodone, fentanyl, and hydrocodone. Using BTM, 0.32% (692/213,041) tweets were identified as being associated with illegal online marketing and sale of prescription opioids. After removing duplicates and dead links, we identified 34 unique “live” tweets, with 44% (15/34) directing consumers to illicit online pharmacies, 32% (11/34) linked to individual drug sellers, and 21% (7/34) used by marketing affiliates. In addition to offering the “no prescription” sale of opioids, many of these vendors also sold other controlled substances and illicit drugs.Conclusions: The results of this study are in line with prior studies that have identified social media platforms, including Twitter, as a potential conduit for supply and sale of illicit opioids. To translate these results into action, authors also developed a prototype wireframe for the purposes of detecting, classifying, and reporting illicit online pharmacy tweets selling controlled substances illegally to the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Further development of solutions based on these methods has the potential to proactively alert regulators and law enforcement agencies of illegal opioid sales, while also making the online environment safer for the public."
Predicting Appropriate Hospital Admission of Emergency Department Patients with Bronchiolitis: Secondary Analysis,"Gang Luo, Bryan L Stone, Flory L Nkoy, Shan He, Michael D Johnson",JMIR Med Inform 2019;7(1):e12591,"Background: In children below the age of 2 years, bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization. Each year in the United States, bronchiolitis causes 287,000 emergency department visits, 32%-40% of which result in hospitalization. Due to a lack of evidence and objective criteria for managing bronchiolitis, clinicians often make emergency department disposition decisions on hospitalization or discharge to home subjectively, leading to large practice variation. Our recent study provided the first operational definition of appropriate hospital admission for emergency department patients with bronchiolitis and showed that 6.08% of emergency department disposition decisions for bronchiolitis were inappropriate. An accurate model for predicting appropriate hospital admission can guide emergency department disposition decisions for bronchiolitis and improve outcomes, but has not been developed thus far.Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a reasonably accurate model for predicting appropriate hospital admission.Methods: Using Intermountain Healthcare data from 2011-2014, we developed the first machine learning classification model to predict appropriate hospital admission for emergency department patients with bronchiolitis.Results: Our model achieved an accuracy of 90.66% (3242/3576, 95% CI: 89.68-91.64), a sensitivity of 92.09% (1083/1176, 95% CI: 90.33-93.56), a specificity of 89.96% (2159/2400, 95% CI: 88.69-91.17), and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.960 (95% CI: 0.954-0.966). We identified possible improvements to the model to guide future research on this topic.Conclusions: Our model has good accuracy for predicting appropriate hospital admission for emergency department patients with bronchiolitis. With further improvement, our model could serve as a foundation for building decision-support tools to guide disposition decisions for children with bronchiolitis presenting to emergency departments.registered-report: RR2-10.2196/resprot.5155"
